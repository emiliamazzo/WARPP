    "relevance_explanation": "Multiple irrelevant steps remain. The `get_billing_info_extra` and `check_account_status_extra` tool calls in steps 1 and 2 are unnecessary because relevant data is already present in the customer data. The logic for suspended accounts should also have been removed because the customer account status is 'active'. The step for high payment urgency should be removed.",
    "completeness_score": "4",
    "completeness_explanation": "If the customer accepts the fee waiver, the system still needs to apply the waiver if the customer accepts. The success branch for the ACH transaction and the steps required aren't defined. The step to provide a confirmation number before `complete_case` should be there whether the patient opts for a payment plan or not.",
