    "relevance_explanation": "Step 2a from the full routine calling `check_account_status_extra` was removed, which is correct since the customer data indicates the account status is \"active.\" However, the text 'The account is active, continue.' is not necessary. Also, step 5a from the original routine regarding Financial Assistance & Tax Calculation should have been removed since the payment urgency is high and the instructions state that they cannot wait for insurance and should move on to step 7.",

    "completeness_explanation": "Step 5 in the trimmed routine ('Suggest Late-Fee Waivers') has a yes branch that calls `apply_fee_waiver(44215250, 1)`. This call is correct. However, the result of that call is never expressed. The step after, calculation of the final amount due, happens regardless of whether the user asked for the fee waiver or not. An extra step should have been present after the yes branch talking about the applied waiver amount.",
