    "relevance_score": "5",
    "relevance_explanation": "The routine includes only the steps relevant to this customer, and irrelevant branches have been removed. The initial steps incorporate the data from `get_billing_info` and `check_account_status` directly, and the logic for suspended accounts and zero balances is correctly omitted. The financial assistance check was also correctly skipped due to high urgency. The type of payment processing (digital wallet) is consistent with the data on file.",
    "completeness_score": "5",
    "completeness_explanation": "The trimmed routine preserves all necessary logic, tool calls, and branches required for this customer scenario. All tool calls like `calculate_patient_responsibility`, `get_wallet_link`, `check_wallet_payment_status`, and `issue_receipt` are correctly retained. The branches regarding payment plan setup and alternate currencies were also kept, since the customer response is unknown and may vary.",
