    "relevance_explanation": "The step calling `calculate_late_fee_waiver_eligibility_extra` was pruned, which is correct given the customer data indicating they are not eligible for a waiver. Also, the account status check correctly skips the suspended account branch. However, Step 11 of the full routine regarding payment plan options should have been removed because the `billing_info['payment_plan_active']` is True. Therefore, the routine should not have included the step to ask the customer if they want to set up a payment plan.",
    "completeness_score": "4",
    "completeness_explanation": "The routine mostly preserves required logic. However, the insurance assistance branch is missing a scenario. It presents the cases where insurance is approved or declined (success or failure). Step 6 in the FULL routine ( Suggest Late-Fee Waivers) was not included, this is acceptable. Step 10 in the full routine (Send Receipt) includes informing the user a receipt has been sent. This message is missing from Step 7, making the routine incomplete.",
