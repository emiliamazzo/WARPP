    "relevance_explanation": "The routine was properly trimmed: all steps are relevant to the customer data provided. Steps related to account suspensions and zero balances were removed, as well as conditional branches only relevant when the payment urgency is low or medium. Additionally, steps regarding late fee waivers and fraud checks were removed.",
    "completeness_score": "4",
    "completeness_explanation": "Most of the required steps were included, but the check for setting up a payment plan after the payment is collected was missed. Since the customer has an active payment plan, this question shouldn't be asked: the final step after the payment should be 'complete_case'.",
