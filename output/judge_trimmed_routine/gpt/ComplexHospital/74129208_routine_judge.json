    "relevance_explanation": "The trimmed routine includes only the steps relevant to the customer, given their active account status, outstanding balance, medium payment urgency, ineligibility for a late fee waiver, and credit card payment method. Irrelevant branches such as the suspended account logic, zero balance logic, and ACH/digital wallet payment options have been correctly removed.",
    "completeness_score": "5",
    "completeness_explanation": "The trimmed routine preserves all necessary logic, tool calls, and branches applicable to the customer. All success and failure branches for conditional tool calls are included, and all steps that were still relevant for this customer have been retained. The routine covers payment urgency, financial assistance, final amount calculation, currency preference, payment processing, receipt generation, and payment plan options. No steps are missing.",
