    "relevance_explanation": "The trimmed routine only includes steps relevant to the customer. Tool calls like `get_billing_info_extra`, `check_account_status_extra`, and `evaluate_payment_urgency_extra` were replaced with direct values from the customer data. The routine correctly skips the suspended account logic based on the customer's 'active' account status.",
    "completeness_score": "5",
    "completeness_explanation": "All necessary logic, tools, and branches that apply to this customer are preserved. The routine includes financial assistance check, final amount calculation, currency options, credit card payment processing, receipt generation, and the payment plan offer.",
