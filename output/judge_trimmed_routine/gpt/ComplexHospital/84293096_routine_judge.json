    "completeness_explanation": "The routine is mostly complete, but it misses the logic to handle the waiver case after the call to `calculate_late_fee_waiver_eligibility_extra`. Specifically, If they are not eligible to waive, the bot is supposed to 'proceed' according to step 6. Step 6 is to calculate patient responsibility at all times. This step is required as the customer data has that the customer is eligible for a waiver.",
