    "relevance_score": "3",
    "relevance_explanation": "Several irrelevant steps were not removed. Specifically, step 2 was intended for regular flyers and should have been skipped since the customer had no flyer status. Step 3 and 6 are related to checking visa requirements, but this function call should have been after the flyer status check and skipped if they had status. Step 7, 8 and 9 should have been chosen based on the payment method of the customer. Since the customer is paying by credit card only step 9 should be included.",
    "completeness_score": "3",
    "completeness_explanation": "Checks surrounding the search and search steps themselves, payment, or visa requirements were missing; the frequent flyer check and related search function (step 4 in the original routine), checking passport information, and choosing the payment method branch are all missing.",
