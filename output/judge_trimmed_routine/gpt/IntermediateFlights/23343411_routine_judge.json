    "relevance_explanation": "The routine is mostly relevant, but the 'api_failure' and 'any other response' branches in step 3 are not necessary. Since these terminal branches all lead to step 6 as the data says is 'eligible' it is negligibly penalised",
    "completeness_score": "4",
    "completeness_explanation": "The routine is mostly complete, but step 6 incorrectly calls `issue_travel_credit`. Since `is_refundable` is false and `purchased_insurance` is also false, it should proceed to call `issue_travel_credit`. But the original routine has a branch that calls `process_refund` if either `refundable` or `insurance` is purchased. This was missed.",
