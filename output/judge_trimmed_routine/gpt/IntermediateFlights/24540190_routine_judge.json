    "relevance_explanation": "The routine correctly prunes irrelevant branches. The customer has more than 30,000 loyalty points, so the branch for welcoming new customers is removed. The booking allows cancellations, so the logic for non-cancellable bookings is removed. Additionally, get_customer_loyalty_info_extra and get_booking_details_extra are removed and replaced with inlined values and a single direct greeting and confirm statement, respectively.",

    "completeness_explanation": "The routine retains all the necessary logic, tools, and branches that apply to this customer. The steps were correctly preserved for calculating the cancellation fee, processing the flight cancellation, issuing travel credit (since they did not purchase insurance and it's not refundable), confirming the cancellation, and completing the case.",
