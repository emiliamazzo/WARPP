    "relevance_explanation": "The routine incorrectly states that the customer's fare rule does not permit cancellation. The customer data clearly shows `cancellation_allowed: false` but `is_refundable: true`. The correct path would be to acknowledge that cancellations are permitted and proceed to check for live cancellation blockers. Steps 4-7 are also completely missing.",

    "completeness_explanation": "The routine misses almost all of the necessary steps. It skips all the steps necessary to check for cancellation blockers, calculate fees, and process refunds. This is a critical omission. The logic after step 2 should not have been trimmed as the customer is eligible for some cancellation based on the data.",
