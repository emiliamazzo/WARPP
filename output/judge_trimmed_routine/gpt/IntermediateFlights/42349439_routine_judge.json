    "relevance_explanation": "The customer's loyalty information retrieval and preferred client greeting were removed, which is good. However, the booking information retrieval step (2a.) was replaced by a single line of text (1a), removing the cancellation condition check in 2b. This is ok as the customer data specifies that cancellation is allowed. However, the conditional logic that allows cancellation (2c) must remain.",

    "completeness_explanation": "Step 1a from the full routine regarding loyalty points was removed. This is fine as it's not dependent on the outcome of a tool call. However, step 6a in the full routine had conditional logic based on refundability/insurance status that was not handled correctly. The trimmed routine omits the check for refundability (6a) and defaults to issuing travel credit, even though refundability should have been factored into choosing which refund path to take.",
