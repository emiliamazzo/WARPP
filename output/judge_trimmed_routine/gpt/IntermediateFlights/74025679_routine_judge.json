    "relevance_explanation": "All steps irrelevant to the customer were pruned. The routine correctly skips steps related to regular flights, passport info, and booking with points because the customer is a Gold frequent flyer with passport info available. It also skips `get_customer_payment_method_extra` and proceeds directly to booking with the debit card.",
    "completeness_score": "4",
    "completeness_explanation": "The routine is mostly complete, but Step 3 informs the customer that Visa information is already in the system, but skips the call to `check visa requirements`. Even though Frequent Flyers have this info already in the system, the check should still occur, and the result communicated to the customer.",
