    "relevance_explanation": "The routine includes steps that are contradictory. The customer's fare rules do not allow cancellations, so step 2 is relevant. Step 1 regarding loyalty information is relevant. Step 3 is also relevant. However, step 2 indicates that we're proceeding to say the fare doesn't permit cancellation, yet does not terminate into step 8 as specified in the full routine. This routine also fails to call \"complete case\" after fare rule rejection.",
    "completeness_score": "2",
    "completeness_explanation": "The routine is missing essential logic for handling a scenario where the fare rules do not permit cancellation and is missing key error handling. The logic should proceed to step 8 and call complete_case after informing the customer that cancellation is not permitted, but does not do so.",
