    "completeness_explanation": "Step 5 from the Full Routine regarding passport information was removed, but this was specifically requested in the prompt to be shown to the customer. The passport number is already in the customer data. Additionally, Step 7 from the Full Routine, which retrieves the payment method and leads to either Step 8 or Step 9, has been skipped, but because the customer has points as a payment method, it should have gone to step 8 which is the equivalent of step 4 in the Trimmed Routine.",
