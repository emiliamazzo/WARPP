    "relevance_explanation": "Step 1 from the original routine was pruned, which is mostly correct. However, the trimming instructions said if they are eligible, include the action of informing that they are eligible. This should be a confirmation step before moving to step two. In addition, the error handling step from the original routine should have been pruned, since it's already included as part of 'Process Withdrawal' step in the trimmed routine.",

    "completeness_explanation": "The initial eligibility check and success confirmation should be expressed to the user. The success branch for 'Process Withdrawal' is missing the confirmation step. The routine also omits the final confirmation message within complete case tool call. The 'Complete Case' step should also provide a confirmation message to the customer, which is missing.",
