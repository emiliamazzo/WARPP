    "relevance_explanation": "The trimmed routine is not fully relevant. Step 1 which checks withdrawal eligibility was skipped even though the information was available and the eligibility check indicated the user *is* eligible, so this step should have been acknowledged and removed. However, because the user *is* eligible by customer data, the negative branch of that step was appropriately removed.",
    "completeness_score": "3",
    "completeness_explanation": "The routine is missing the initial withdrawal check and confirmation. It also doesn't confirm success before 'Complete Case', sharing final amount with customer. Both are necessary, and failure branch contains retry which is needed.",
