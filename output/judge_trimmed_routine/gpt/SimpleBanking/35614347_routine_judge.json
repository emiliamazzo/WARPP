    "relevance_explanation": "Step 1 from the original routine, which checks withdrawal eligibility using customer data was completely removed. The customer data indicates the customer is eligible, and the initial step informs the customer and closes the case if not true. Since the customer is eligible, logic to handle ineligible cases should have been removed but the tool call itself should have been preserved.",

    "completeness_explanation": "The initial step to check withdrawal eligibility was completely removed. Based on customer data, the user is eligible, so the negative branch would be removed, but the initial eligibility check is still required. Additionally, the error handling was not done correctly. It should have been preserved within the 'Process Withdrawal' Step as a failure branch.",
