    "relevance_explanation": "The routine is mostly relevant. However, the step \"Retry once\" within the Error Handling section feels a bit out of place. While it's good to have error handling, automatically retrying without acknowledging the error to the customer first might not be ideal. It would be better to prompt the customer before retrying, or remove the automatic retry and escalate immediately.",
    "completeness_score": "5",
    "completeness_explanation": "All necessary logic, tools, and branches for this customer are preserved. The `get_account_type` call was correctly replaced with the known account type, and no other steps appear to be missing based on the customer data and the full routine.",
