    "relevance_explanation": "The trimmed routine only includes steps relevant to the customer. The check withdrawal eligibility step was correctly removed since the customer data indicates they are eligible, rendering that logic path unnecessary.",
    "completeness_score": "3",
    "completeness_explanation": "The routine is missing the tool call `process_retirement_withdrawal` success branch, as well as the initial check of eligibility using the `check_withdrawal_eligibility` tool. Because the customer data contains \"isEligible: true\", the tool call was not needed, the result was already available and that branch was handled correctly. The success branch from `process_retirement_withdrawal` was NOT handled correctly. This required a confirmation message step to the customer, and was omitted from the final routine.",
