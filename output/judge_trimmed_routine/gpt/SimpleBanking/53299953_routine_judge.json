    "relevance_explanation": "The step calling `get_account_type_extra(customer_id)` in the first step was removed, and the account type was correctly inlined. The logic branch 4a related to `client_level` being STANDARD was correctly removed because `client_level` is PREMIUM in the customer data, therefore `apply_address_hold` is irrelevant. However, the first step is missing the client level. It should be removed or the information should be included.",

    "completeness_explanation": "The call to `get_account_type_extra` was replaced with inlined account type. However, the client level was not properly addressed. The customer is PREMIUM, but the agent is never told this fact. The system should reveal this fact as part of the original prompt to show the case routing and specific policy application.",
