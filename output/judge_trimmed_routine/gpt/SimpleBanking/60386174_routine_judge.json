    "relevance_explanation": "The trimmed routine includes the error handling step, which has a general condition and is not specific to the current customer data. It's only needed as fallback. Also, the complete case could have been placed after successful withdrawal and error handling should be removed",

    "completeness_explanation": "The first step of the original routine, Check Withdrawal Eligibility with the tool call, `check_withdrawal_eligibility_extra(customer_id)`, was skipped even though its outputs `isEligible` was present in the customer data. This step was important because if the customer was not eligible, the flow should have terminated. The routine is also missing the initial check on isEligible to immediately complete the case.",
