    "relevance_explanation": "The initial step of checking withdrawal eligibility was skipped because the customer is eligible. However error handling steps were unnecessarily retained even though the failure conditions are resolved later in a success condition. Additionally, the retry step should have been removed if the customer is still failing.",

    "completeness_explanation": "The routine is missing the confirmation message upon successful withdrawal which was part of step 3 in the full routine after the 'If success' condition was met. Furthermore case completion should not include any message after calling the complete_case tool -- this should be included as part of confirmation rather than in step 3.",
