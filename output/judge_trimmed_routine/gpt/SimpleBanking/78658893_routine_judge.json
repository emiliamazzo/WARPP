    "relevance_explanation": "Step 1 of the original routine, \"Check Withdrawal Eligibility\", was skipped even though it contains a `check_withdrawal_eligibility_extra(customer_id)` call. The returned value determines whether the customer is eligible, which is required before preceding with the rest of the routine. Also, the \"Error Handling\" steps should be pruned because they are after the terminal `complete_case(...)` calls.",

    "completeness_explanation": "The routine did not include the initial check for withdrawal eligibility. The first step in the full routine calls `check_withdrawal_eligibility_extra(customer_id)`. The conditional branch for not eligible results in a close case, this logic is entirely missing in the trimmed routine. In addition, the retry logic should have been removed, given that it occurs after a terminal `complete_case(...)`.",
