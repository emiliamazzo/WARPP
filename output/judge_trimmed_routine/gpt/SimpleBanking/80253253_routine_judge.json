The tool call `check_withdrawal_eligibility_extra(customer_id)` should have been included as the customer data doesn't make it unnecessary, but it was determined from the data that the customer *is* eligible, so excluding this section is only a minor error.",

    "completeness_explanation": "The success branch from `process_retirement_withdrawal` was not implemented, specifically sharing the final amount with the customer. This is required. The tool call itself was kept.",
