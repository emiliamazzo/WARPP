    "relevance_score": "3",
    "relevance_explanation": "The routine includes steps from the general flow, but it misses pruning steps irrelevant based on customer data. Step 1: Check Withdrawal Eligibility, should have been removed since the customer data indicates they are eligible for withdrawal, rendering this check unnecessary. Additionally, error handling should have been removed since it only applies if a step fails initially.",
    "completeness_score": "4",
    "completeness_explanation": "The routine misses the confirmation message after a successful withdrawal. After the `process_retirement_withdrawal` is successful, the routine does not `complete_case`. So, steps 3 and 4 from the original routine should have been included after confirming success.",
