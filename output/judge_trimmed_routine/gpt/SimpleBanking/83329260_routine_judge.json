    "relevance_explanation": "The routine generally includes relevant steps. However, the get_account_type_extra tool call was replaced with the outcome directly, which is correct for inlining. However, the customer's account type is \"401K\" and the client level is \"STANDARD\". The routine retained step 4, which checks the client level. This step should have been directly included without the conditional check.",

    "completeness_explanation": "All required logic for this customer was preserved. The error handling logic is retained, which is the generic/fallback logic that would be included even when the specific error cases are not triggered by customer data.",
