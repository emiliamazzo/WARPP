    "relevance_explanation": "The initial step checking withdrawal eligibility was pruned, which is partially correct because the customer data indicates they *are* eligible. However, the routine fails to account for a potential failure of `process_retirement_withdrawal` which could occur regardless of eligibility. Error handling logic related to a potential failure of `process_retirement_withdrawal` was omitted.",
    "completeness_score": "3",
    "completeness_explanation": "The routine is missing the branch for if `process_retirement_withdrawal` is *not* successful, as well as the error handling step. Additionally, in step 2, success is not guaranteed, so if `process_retirement_withdrawal` call fails, steps 3 and 4 should not run.",
