    "relevance_explanation": "Step 1 from the original routine was skipped even though the customer data (`information_available.check_withdrawal_eligibility.isEligible = true`) demonstrates that the customer is eligible and the routine should have continued to step 2 after confirming eligibility.

    "completeness_explanation": "The routine dropped the initial eligibility check, but retained all logic from steps 2-4. The success path was also maintained, so the overall completeness is relatively high.",
