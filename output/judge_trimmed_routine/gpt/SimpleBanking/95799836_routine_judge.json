    "relevance_explanation": "Step 1 from the original routine `check_withdrawal_eligibility_extra(customer_id)` was not removed even though the customer data `information_available` shows `isEligible: true`. Step 5, the Error Handling section, was also kept, which contains retry logic inappropriate considering the positive eligibility check.",
    "completeness_score": "3",
    "completeness_explanation": "The routine is missing the initial eligibility check, which was present in the original routine - even though the data shows they are eligible, one should not assume that the tool is not run, as we may still need that confirmation. Another required piece of logic that is missing is the positive acknowledgement from Step 2 `process_retirement_withdrawal` when the function comes back as a success. Furthermore, the Error Handling step implies a retry, which it only shows the failure case; the success case after 'retry once' is never handled in the trimmed routine.",
