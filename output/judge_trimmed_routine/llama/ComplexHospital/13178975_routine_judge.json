    "relevance_explanation": "The routine retains several irrelevant steps. Step 5, Processing the Payment, should be placed after calculating the final amount due in step 7. Also, the logic flow for step 6 and 7 is not correctly implemented. Step 7 (final amount due) should occur BEFORE step 6 (currency preference). Step 7 prompts the customer to proceed with the payment based on the final amount, and only after a positive response, the routine should proceed to step 6 to inquire about currency preference.",
    "completeness_score": "3",
    "completeness_explanation": "Several steps were missed: After successful process_payment (step 5d), the receipt should have been sent. Also, step 10a (Provide confirmation number) is missing, and the flow of logic at the end of step 5 is incomplete: If the fraudulent check is flagged in step 5b, the routine calls `get_hospital_contact_info(hospital_id)` shares the hotline number then calls `complete_case(customer_id)`. Step 5c asks the system to 'otherwise, perform 3D-Secure with `initiate_3ds_auth(customer_id)`'. The 'otherwise' is not supposed to exist because the case should already been terminated in 5b. Step 4 (Assess Payment Urgency) is missing the logic for medium and low urgency.",
