    "completeness_score": "5",
    "completeness_explanation": "All necessary logic, tool calls, and branches that apply to this customer (customer with high urgency, credit card payment method, and no payment plan in place) have been preserved. The routine correctly handles potential fraud check failures and 3DS authentication failures.",
