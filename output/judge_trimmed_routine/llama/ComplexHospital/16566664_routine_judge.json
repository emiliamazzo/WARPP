    "completeness_explanation": "Step 11 from the original routine, concerning payment plans, is missing. The customer data indicates `payment_plan_active` is `true`, so the routine should contain decision-making for both when the customer replies yes and no to wanting a payment plan. Step 10 from the trimmed routine, providing a confirmation number is also missing.",
