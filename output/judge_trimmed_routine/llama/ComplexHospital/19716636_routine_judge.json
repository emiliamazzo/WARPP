    "relevance_explanation": "All branches and tool calls irrelevant to this customer were correctly removed. The customer data shows they have an active account, a medium payment urgency, and is not eligible for a late fee waiver. Logic related to suspended accounts, high/low payment urgencies, and late fee waivers was properly pruned.",
    "completeness_score": "4",
    "completeness_explanation": "The tool call `calculate_patient_responsibility(customer_id, insurance_provider)` was skipped, which is required before determining the patient responsibility amount. Also, step 8a 'provide confirmation number' is present, however, step 10a had been called, but neither returned nor stored the confirmation number. This confirmation number is therefore unavailable.",
