    "relevance_explanation": "All branches and tool calls irrelevant to this customer were correctly removed. The delinquent account status, outstanding balance, and medium urgency were accounted for. Logic related to suspended accounts, zero balances, high/low urgency, and late fee waivers were properly pruned.",

    "completeness_explanation": "The routine is mostly complete. Step 5 has two branches saying that insurance either will or will not cover the payment. Whatever response occurs, there is no follow up from the agent after either message. This step is incomplete. Step 8 is also incomplete, specifically regarding verifying payment status. The available tools lists `get_wallet_link` and `check_wallet_payment_status`. There is no messaging to the user about the results of `check_wallet_payment_status`, as it occurs after the tool call.",
