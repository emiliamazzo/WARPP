    "relevance_explanation": "The trimmed routine contains only steps relevant to a customer with a delinquent account, a high urgency payment, and eligibility for a late fee waiver. Irrelevant branches for suspended or zero balance accounts have been removed.",

    "completeness_explanation": "The routine is mostly complete, but the final step of providing a confirmation number before calling `complete_case(customer_id)` in step 12 is missing if the user proceeds with payment. Also, the user has an outstanding balance and the payment method on file is 'Digital Wallet', so step 9 should call the `check_wallet_payment_status(payment_id)` tool only after the payment is confirmed for the first time.",
