    "relevance_score": "3",
    "relevance_explanation": "Several irrelevant steps are included. The customer is not eligible for a late fee waiver (from customer data), so step 6 in the original routine should have been omitted. Step 8 in the original routine asks about paying in another currency, and it should be included because it applies to all customers. Steps 5a and 5b from the Full Routine are irrelevant because the payment urgency is high, so these should have been pruned.",
    "completeness_score": "3",
    "completeness_explanation": "Several required steps are missing. `calculate_patient_responsibility` is missing (step 7 from full routine), which should be called to get the total amount due. Step 8 from the full routine, asking customer if they want to pay with another currency is missing, which applies to all customers. The logic for the success and failure branches of the payment processing were not added. Also, the confirmation number in step 12a from Full Routine is missing.",
