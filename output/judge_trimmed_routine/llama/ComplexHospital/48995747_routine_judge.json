    "relevance_explanation": "The routine was correctly trimmed to include only steps relevant to the customer based on the provided data. Irrelevant branches related to suspended or delinquent accounts, zero balances, insurance coverage for non-urgent cases, and alternative payment methods were removed. The inlining of data from get_billing_info and other initial tool calls was also completed successfully.",

    "completeness_explanation": "The routine preserves almost all necessary steps including late fee waivers, payment amount calculation, currency questions, digital wallet processing, payment receipts and plans. However, the routine is missing the step of informing a user that a receipt has been sent to them after calling `issue_receipt(customer_id, patient_responsibility_amount)`.",
