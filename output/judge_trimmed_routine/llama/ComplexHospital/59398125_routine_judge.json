    "completeness_explanation": "Step 7 from the full routine (now step 6) has logic that is still relevant and should be included: 'Always Ask Client if They Want to Pay in USD or Another Currency' was retained, which is good, but it occurs *after* the 'no' branch of the payment question. If the customer says no to paying, the routine should first ask about currency before calling complete_case. The payment plan question (step 11 originally, 10 now) should come *before* finalize as well (and is missing the 'no' branch leading to complete_case).",
