    "relevance_explanation": "The routine was correctly trimmed, removing unnecessary branches and tool calls based on the customer's account status, outstanding balance, payment urgency, and payment method. Irrelevant steps related to suspended accounts, zero balances, financial assistance (due to high payment urgency), late fee waivers and other payment methods were correctly removed.",
    "completeness_score": "4",
    "completeness_explanation": "The step offering a payment plan (step 11 in the original routine) was skipped. Since the customer does have an active payment plan according to the customer data, it might be reasonable to skip the offer to set up a new one, but it is a key element in the happy path that should be implemented.",
