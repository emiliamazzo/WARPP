    "relevance_explanation": "Step 2a in the full routine calls `check_account_status_extra(customer_id)`. The trimmed routine resolves this with \"The account is active\". But step 2b (suspended account -> contact provider + complete_case) should be pruned. Step 1a in the full routine calls `get_billing_info_extra(customer_id)`, but only keeps the balance. This step should have been completely dropped. Step 5 begins with \"If payment urgency is 'low' OR 'medium', check for financial assistance.\" Since urgency is 'medium' here, only that branch is retained. However, the 'high' branch is not explicitly removed.",
    "completeness_score": "3",
    "completeness_explanation": "Multiple issues: 1) Step 4b from the original routine has two possible paths (approved and declined). The trimmed routine only keeps the first line and the function call. It needs to keep the full if/else statement. 2) Suggest late-fee waivers. The trimmed routine only keeps the first line and the function call. It needs to keep the full if/else statement, since we don't know if they will say yes. 3) \"6. Always Calculate Final Amount Due\" is missing the negative response branch. 6b skips the logic if the customer declines and jumps straight to step 7. 4) The full routine has Step 8 ALWAYS asking the customer if they would like to pay in another currency. This is missing from the trimmed response, suggesting the customer is always going to pay in USD.",
