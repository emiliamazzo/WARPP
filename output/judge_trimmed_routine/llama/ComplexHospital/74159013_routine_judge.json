    "relevance_explanation": "All steps irrelevant to the customer were removed. Specifically, the parts related to suspended accounts, zero balance, financial assistance (due to high urgency), and late fee waivers (customer not eligible) were correctly pruned. The routine only contains logic applicable for an active account with an outstanding balance and high payment urgency, paying with a credit card.",
    "completeness_score": "5",
    "completeness_explanation": "All logic required for the customer scenario (active account, outstanding balance, payment urgency high, paying with credit card, no active payment plan) is preserved, including necessary tool calls and branching based on customer input.",
