    "relevance_explanation": "The routine was trimmed to only include steps relevant to a customer with an active account, a balance to pay, a medium payment urgency, and a credit card payment method. Unnecessary branches and tool calls related to suspended accounts, zero balances, different payment urgencies, late fee waivers and other payment methods were removed.",
    "completeness_score": "4",
    "completeness_explanation": "The step offering a payment plan (step 11 in the full routine) has been removed, even though the customer does not have an active payment plan and this step should have been included. This question must always be asked if billing_info['payment_plan_active'] is False.",
