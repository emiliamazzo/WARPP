    "relevance_explanation": "Step 1 from the full routine regarding loyalty points was removed, which is correct. Step 2b was removed which is also correct because cancellations are allowed. Steps 5a and 6a incorrectly collapse two conditional paths into only one. Specifically, the logic concerning refunds when insurance has been purchased was removed when it should have been retained: \"Process Refund or Issue Travel Credit a. If refundable or insurance was purchased for this booking: - Call process_refund(customer_id, booking_id, payment_method, cancellation_fee) using the payment_method stored for the customer.  b. Otherwise: - Call issue_travel_credit(customer_id, booking_id, cancellation_fee)\"",

    "completeness_explanation": "The routine is missing the check for refund eligibility or insurance purchase. Since the customer purchased insurance, the routine should call `process_refund` instead of `issue_travel_credit` in step 5. The policy/fee description in 4a should include insurance information.",
