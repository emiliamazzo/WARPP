The loyalty information and booking data have been correctly interpreted and used to personalize the routine. The steps not relevant, like handling fares that do not permit cancellation, were pruned which is correct.",

    "completeness_explanation": "The trimmed routine preserves all necessary logic, tools, and branches that apply to this customer. All required tool calls like `check_cancellation_blockers`, `calculate_cancellation_fee`, `cancel_flight`, `issue_travel_credit`, and `complete_case` are present and in the correct order, and all are still relevant for this customer case.",
