    "relevance_explanation": "Multiple issues: Step 1 retained the detail about the customer having 28606 points, which should be pruned because it comes directly from customer data. In step 6, the 'payment_method' wasn't known, and it should call `process_refund` instead of `issue_travel_credit` since it purchased insurance. Also, the `complete_case` block includes thanking the customer, an action external to the tool.",
    "completeness_score": "3",
    "completeness_explanation": "Missing the 'b' branch from step 5. The 'eligible' branch from 'check_cancellation_blockers' does not have implementation steps. The result of \"api_failure' and 'any other response' jump to step #7 but 6 should have been visited. Step 6 selects logic based on insurance, but the original logic selects a path based on refundability OR insurance, and then calls different tools.",
