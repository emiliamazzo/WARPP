Because the customer is a Gold frequent flyer, the routine skips the regular flight search. The passport number and payment method (points) are inlined, eliminating those extractions. The check visa information is no longer relevant as the customer is a frequent flyer. The final routine only includes the logic that applies to the customer.",
