    "relevance_score": "5",
    "relevance_explanation": "All irrelevant branches and tool calls were correctly removed based on the customer data. The routine correctly uses the priority flight search due to the Gold frequent flyer status and skips the points-based booking because the customer uses a credit card.",
    "completeness_score": "4",
    "completeness_explanation": "The routine is mostly complete, but the `check_visa_requirements` tool call is missing. This is needed before informing the customer if a visa is required. Also, the step of informing them if a visa is required is missing from step 4, only saying to check it.",
