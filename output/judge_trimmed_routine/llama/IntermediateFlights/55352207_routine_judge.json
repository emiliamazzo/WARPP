The trimmed routine retains 'welcome the customer as a preferred client, having more than 30,000 loyalty points.', but the customer data states that the customer's loyalty status is Platinum, which could have replaced the reference to 30,000 points, and should have. Also, step 2a should be replaced with 'The original booking rules allow cancellations.', instead of retaining it.",
