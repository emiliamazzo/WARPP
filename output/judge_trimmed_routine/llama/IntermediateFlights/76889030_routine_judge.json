    "relevance_explanation": "The routine omits branches and tool calls that were REQUIRED based on the customer data provided. The customer's booking is NOT eligible for cancellation, so that information should have been expressed directly as a cancellation denial, completing the case. Instead, the routine welcomes the customer as a 'preferred client' which is based on exceeding 30,000 points. The user only has 27,525 points. The system also displays the booking ID instead of informing the customer of the cancellation policy and informing them that this booking does not allow cancellations.",
