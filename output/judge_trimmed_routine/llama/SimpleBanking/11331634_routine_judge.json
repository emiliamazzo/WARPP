    "relevance_explanation": "Step 1, checking withdrawal eligibility, was removed even though it is relevant based on the customer data which contains information under the 'check_withdrawal_eligibility' key. The result of the eligibility check (isEligible: true) should have been inlined, and the associated branch removed if the check was negative, but the initial check should not have been removed entirely. Also the customer id should have been used as a variable instead of hardcoding it in every use of the function.",
    "completeness_score": "1",
    "completeness_explanation": "The entire first step was removed. This is not acceptable, the fact that isEligible is true should have been used to evaluate the first if, but if the eligibility check had failed, it would have been necessary to inform the customer and close the case by calling complete_case. Also the error handling step was removed as well, meaning there's no fault tolerance.",
