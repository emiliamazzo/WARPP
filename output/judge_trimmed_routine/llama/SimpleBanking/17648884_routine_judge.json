    "relevance_explanation": "The initial eligibility check was not relevant for the customer based on the data. However, Step 5, Error Handling, should have been trimmed, as it applies only to failure conditions not explicitly relevant after the initial eligibility check.",

    "completeness_explanation": "Step 1 `check_withdrawal_eligibility_extra(customer_id)` should have occurred. The `_extra` suffix would get removed since the required fields are present in the customer data, but the step must exist to check the 'isEligible' parameter. The negative branch, where isEligible is `false`, should have been pruned but the tool call remains required. Step 5 involving error handling also should have been kept.",
