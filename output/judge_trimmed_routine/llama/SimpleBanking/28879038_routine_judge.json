    "relevance_explanation": "The initial step of checking withdrawal eligibility was skipped, which is incorrect since the agent needs to confirm the eligibility. Replacing `customer_id` with the value is relevant. Too much was trimmed, as the data just provides that they are eligible but it doesn't mean the step should have been removed.",
    "completeness_score": "4",
    "completeness_explanation": "The check for withdrawal eligibility was dropped. While the data confirms eligibility, the routine should still include the eligibility check step (including the tool call). It's a minor error because the only effect is skipping one check and related 'not eligible' branch.",
