    "relevance_explanation": "The initial eligibility check was skipped, even though it uses values ONLY returned in the tool call `check_withdrawal_eligibility_extra(customer_id)`. Skipping this check means the routine might continue even if the customer isn't eligible. Also, the customer ID was inlined in the `process_retirement_withdrawal` call but not in the `complete_case` call, when it should have been.",

    "completeness_explanation": "Because the routine skips the initial eligibility check, it misses the entire negative branch that would have resulted in calling `complete_case`. Also the error handling step was completely removed which should be kept.",
