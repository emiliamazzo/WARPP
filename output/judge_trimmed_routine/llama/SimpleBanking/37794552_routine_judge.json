    "relevance_explanation": "The initial greeting prompt and confirmation step were removed, but step 1 should have included the inline value of `account_type`: 401K, `client_level`: STANDARD and then asked if the user wanted to proceed.

    "completeness_explanation": "As mentioned in relevance, the prompt to continue after the account information is missing. This prompt is also missing because the `get_account_type_extra` was just removed and not inlined in the proper way.",
