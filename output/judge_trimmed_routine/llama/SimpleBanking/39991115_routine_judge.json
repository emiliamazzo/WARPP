    "relevance_explanation": "The `get_account_type_extra` call was correctly removed and the `account_type` inlined. However, there's a branch in step 4 which applies address hold based on `client_level`. Since the `client_level` is STANDARD, the condition `if client_level is STANDARD` is already satisfied and doesn't need to exist.",

    "completeness_explanation": "All necessary logic for this customer was preserved. The trimmed routine retains essential steps and tool calls relevant to a customer with a ROTH_IRA account and STANDARD client level.",
