    "relevance_explanation": "The routine includes the full error handling block at the end. While technically reachable, it should be pruned because retrying the steps after the final complete case call (step 5) is not useful. The 'Ask for confirmation to proceed with the address update' step was also removed in step 1, but it should be added back in to confirm continuation.",

    "completeness_explanation": "The trimmed routine is missing the prompt to confirm proceeding with the address update after informing the user of their account type. This step is important for user confirmation before continuing to collect address details.",
