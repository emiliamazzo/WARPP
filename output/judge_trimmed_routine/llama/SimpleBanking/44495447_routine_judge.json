    "relevance_explanation": "The call to `get_account_type_extra` was correctly replaced by inlining the account type in step 1. However, step 4a, which involves applying an address hold, was incorrectly removed. The customer has a PREMIUM client level, but this logic applies to STANDARD clients only and should have been pruned. Since 'PREMIUM' should bypass conditional logic, the routine should proceed directly to step 5.",

    "completeness_explanation": "All necessary logic and tool calls are preserved. The only omitted step was the one related to applying the address hold, which was irrelevant based on the customer's client level.",
