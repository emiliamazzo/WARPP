    "relevance_score": "4",
    "relevance_explanation": "The `get_account_type_extra` tool call was correctly removed and replaced with the retrieved account type information directly in the text. However, the conditional check based on `client_level` in step 4 was not removed, even though the customer's `client_level` is \"STANDARD\". The routine should have directly included the `apply_address_hold` function instead of having the if condition. Also, the tool retry branch in error handling should have been removed, since it's specified to retry only once.",

    "completeness_explanation": "All required steps and tool calls for the provided customer data were preserved in the trimmed routine. All tool calls are still present and no steps were dropped.",
