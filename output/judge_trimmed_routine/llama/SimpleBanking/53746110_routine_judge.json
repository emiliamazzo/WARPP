    "relevance_explanation": "The `get_account_type_extra` tool call was correctly removed and the output was inlined. However, the conditional logic for `client_level` should have been removed. Since `client_level` is \"STANDARD\", the address hold logic will always be executed, so there's no need to retain the conditional check in step 4. Step 6 remains which is unnecessary.",
    "completeness_score": "5",
    "completeness_explanation": "All necessary logic and tools are preserved. The trimmed routine correctly includes prompting for address, validating it, updating it, applying the address hold (since `client_level` is STANDARD), and completing the case.",
