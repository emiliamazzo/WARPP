    "relevance_explanation": "The `get_account_type_extra` tool call in Step 1 was correctly removed because the account type (ROTH_IRA) and client level (STANDARD) are available in the customer data. The `customer_id` was also correctly inlined in the `update_address`, `apply_address_hold`, and `complete_case` tool calls. However, the error handling section and validation retry loop were retained without pruning, even though these paths are not guaranteed to occur given the customer's data.",

    "completeness_explanation": "All necessary steps and logic paths relevant to the customer were preserved. No tool calls or messages were omitted.",
