    "completeness_score": "4",
    "completeness_explanation": "The trimmed routine misses the branch where `get_account_type_extra` is called, and applies data from the `customer_data` to inform the customer of their account type, but this account type and level should result in calling `apply_address_hold`. The code also omits the branch with `_extra` in the account information call, but that's fine given the provided customer data has all the needed data.",
