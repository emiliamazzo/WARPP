    "relevance_explanation": "The trimmed routine is mostly relevant. However, in step 1, the call to `get_account_type_extra(customer_id)` was removed but the account type and client level information is present in the CUSTOMER DATA. The `get_account_type_extra` tool call should have been replaced with inlined values, and it was only partially done. The `client_level` of \"Standard\" in the customer data informs step 4a, and that client_level = \"STANDARD\" so the logic was correct to keep step 4. Also `complete_case` is called multiple times which is relevant, but I understand that is to happen with the error handling which cannot be trimmed and it comes directly from the original routine.",
    "completeness_score": "5",
    "completeness_explanation": "The trimmed routine seems to have retained all necessary logic, tools, and branches applicable to this customer. All of the correct tool calls are kept, and there doesn't appear to be anything missing. The error handling logic is kept and the correct logic based on original client level being standard is kept.",
