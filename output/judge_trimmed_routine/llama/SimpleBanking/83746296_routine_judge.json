    "relevance_explanation": "Step 4a related to applying an address hold based on client level was removed, which is correct as the client level is PREMIUM. However, the `get_account_type_extra(customer_id)` call was replaced with direct information, but the customer ID was not placed in the `update_address` and `complete_case` tool calls in steps 3 and 5. They should've been replaced with the customer ID.",
    "completeness_score": "5",
    "completeness_explanation": "All necessary steps and branches relevant to the customer were preserved. The removal of address hold logic and inlining account information with customer data was properly executed.",
