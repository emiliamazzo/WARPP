    "relevance_explanation": "The call to `get_account_type_extra` was correctly replaced with an inline value from the customer data. Step 4a regarding applying an address hold was correctly removed because the customer's client level is PREMIUM, not STANDARD. However, the `apply_address_hold` logic should have been entirely removed, including the if statement that contains it.",

    "completeness_explanation": "All necessary logic for this customer's data was preserved. The trimmed routine includes all required steps and tool calls for an address update case for a PREMIUM level customer.",
