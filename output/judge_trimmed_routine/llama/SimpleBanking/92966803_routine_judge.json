    "relevance_explanation": "The routine is mostly relevant. However, step 1 still uses a generic prompt instead of inlining or removing. The call to `get_account_type_extra` was removed, which is correct, but the account type ('401K') could have been inlined directly into the confirmation question.",
    "completeness_score": "5",
    "completeness_explanation": "All necessary steps for this customer are preserved. The routine correctly handles account confirmation, address validation, update, hold, and completion. Error handling is also included.",
