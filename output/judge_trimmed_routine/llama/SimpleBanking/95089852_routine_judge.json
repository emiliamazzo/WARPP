    "relevance_score": "4",
    "relevance_explanation": "The routine is mostly relevant, but it includes the error handling step. Since the customer data does not include any information about potential error scenarios, and without further information or likelihood of error, it would be most efficient to prune the error handling and only add it back if it becomes relevant at the point of error.",
    "completeness_score": "5",
    "completeness_explanation": "The trimmed routine accurately retains all necessary steps and logic that apply to the customer. The `check_withdrawal_eligibility_extra` tool call was replaced with the result, and the rest of the routine remained, as required.",
