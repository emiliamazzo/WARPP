    "relevance_explanation": "The initial step to 'Check Withdrawal Eligibility' using `check_withdrawal_eligibility_extra(customer_id)` and the subsequent conditional logic was not included due to the customer data indicating eligibility. While understandable based on the data, this step is crucial and must be included to ensure that a re-evaluation would be completed if the eligibility values were not available.",
    "completeness_score": "2",
    "completeness_explanation": "The 'Check Withdrawal Eligibility' check should not have been removed. Additionally, the error handling step is missing. This is a critical omission, as it leaves the agent unable to gracefully handle potential process failures and inform the customer appropriately. Furthermore, the customer_id should not be inlined, as it could change or fail to be present, therefore it is incorrect to hardcode it.",
