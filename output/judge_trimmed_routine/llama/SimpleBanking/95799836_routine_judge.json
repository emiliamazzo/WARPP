    "relevance_explanation": "The initial step, checking withdrawal eligibility using `check_withdrawal_eligibility_extra(customer_id)`, should have been removed entirely because `customer_id` 95799836 has `\"isEligible\": true` in their data, making the conditional branch irrelevant. Also there's an error handling fallback branch for any step failing that is not relevant.",
    "completeness_score": "3",
    "completeness_explanation": "The call in step 2, `process_retirement_withdrawal(customer_id, withdrawal_amount)` should be `process_retirement_withdrawal(95799836, withdrawal_amount)`. Without the substitution of the customer id the tool would error. Additionally, the user is not alerted to the confirmation that the withdrawal has succeeded, which is a failure of the confirmation steps as well as not displaying the final ammount after the retirment withdrawal is made.",
