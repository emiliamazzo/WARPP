    "relevance_explanation": "Step 4a was removed, which is correct because this customer is a PREMIUM client. However, the `get_account_type_extra` tool call was removed and replaced with its output (ROTH_IRA, PREMIUM). While the account type was presented directly to the user, inlineing client_level `PREMIUM` was not necessary because it is still used in subsequent conditional logic. Therefore, this conditional logic relating to `PREMIUM` should have been executed, but was incorrectly fully removed.",
    "completeness_score": "4",
    "completeness_explanation": "The routine is mostly complete. However, step 4a from the original routine includes the logic that is specific for a STANDARD client. Since the client is PREMIUM and that branch should not have been executed, it does not need to be included. However, step 3 - `update_address` should have the customer ID, and this trimmed routine included it. However, the complete_case also has an customer id missing. The customer id should be populated by a variable and not a magic number. Additionally, the error handling should include the ID as well as part of the `complete_case` tool call.",
