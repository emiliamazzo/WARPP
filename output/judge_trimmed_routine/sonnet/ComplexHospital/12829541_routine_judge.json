    "relevance_score": "4",
    "relevance_explanation": "Almost all irrelevant steps were removed. However, step 3 still contains both branches for the get_insurance_payment_portion result (approved and declined). The routine does not know which will occur, so this isn't necessarily an error, but ideally, if the insurance payment portion was retrieved in the beginning via lookups, only one branch would be present. Also, step 10 'Finalize' includes logic after 'issue_receipt,' which should be removed.",
    "completeness_score": "4",
    "completeness_explanation": "Most required logic is preserved. Step 4 is missing the positive branch to the suggested late-fee waiver: if the user says 'yes', call `apply_fee_waiver(12829541, 13)` should have been included.",
