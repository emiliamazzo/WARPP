    "relevance_explanation": "The `get_billing_info` and `evaluate_payment_urgency` tool calls at the beginning were correctly removed and their data was inlined. However, several irrelevant branches remain. In step 4, both the `if approved` and `if declined` branches are kept, but based on the instructions, only one should be retained, if the insurance is approved based on the customer data. Also in Step 5, the question should not be asked. It should be applied automatically based on data from `calculate_late_fee_waiver_eligibility`. Step 11 should not be included either - `complete_case()` was not called after the `if no` branch in the 'calculate final amount due' step, even though it should have prompted routine termination.",
    "completeness_score": "4",
    "completeness_explanation": "The initial steps related to account status and balance were correctly simplified. The core payment flow is present. However, step 5b is missing a yes success branch. `apply_fee_waiver` runs no matter what, so there should be code for each branch, as is the standard.",
