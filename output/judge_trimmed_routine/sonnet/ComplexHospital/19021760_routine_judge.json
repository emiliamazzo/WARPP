    "relevance_explanation": "Several unnecessary steps were kept. Step 1 (balancing being $247 already) should have been extracted. Step 2 also extracts urgency and days overdue. Step 8 is unreachable if the previous 'If no' case is triggered, and should've been removed as it's after a `complete_case()` call.",
    "completeness_score": "3",
    "completeness_explanation": "Many required steps were skipped. The steps for offering a payment plan were skipped, even though `billing_info['payment_plan_active'] is False`. Specifically, step 3 should have success/failure branches for the `apply_fee_waiver` call. Also, Step 6 is missing its success and failure conditions from the `check_wallet_payment_status` tool call. Step 8 is also missing step a, 'Provide confirmation number'.",
