    "completeness_explanation": "The routine is mostly complete. However, steps related to processing a 'yes' answer to the late fee waiver, a 'yes' to alternative currency, and steps a. and b. after a customer replies 'yes' to setting up a payment plan were missed. It is assumed that customer will reply yes to setting up a payment plan and the necessary question and tool call are included. It is assumed they say \"Yes\" to paying in another currency, then steps 'Get the desired currency' and 'Tell them \"That's [convertedAmount] in [currency].\"' should be included.",
