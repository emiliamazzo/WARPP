    "relevance_explanation": "The routine includes only logic relevant to the customer based on the provided data. The steps related to suspended accounts, zero outstanding balance, financial assistance due to low urgency, late fee waivers, credit card and ACH payment methods, and payment plan setup were correctly removed. The Digital Wallet payment flow was correctly retained.",
    "completeness_score": "4",
    "completeness_explanation": "The routine is mostly complete, but omits Step 11 from the full routine (Offer Payment Plan). Since billing_info['payment_plan_active'] is True, Step 11 in the Full Routine states a conditional: 'If there is no active payment plant (billing_info['payment_plan_active'] is False:...'. That conditional branch SHOULD NOT activate since the billing info indicates 'payment_plan_active': true and the Step should be entirely skipped so this is correct trimming.",
