    "relevance_explanation": "The trimmed routine includes only the relevant steps for a customer with an active account, a balance, and a high payment urgency. Irrelevant branches, like the suspended account logic and the financial assistance check (which is skipped for high urgency cases), have been correctly removed. The initial steps of gathering billing info and checking account status have been collapsed into a single statement, as the key information from those steps is directly available in the customer data.",
    "completeness_score": "5",
    "completeness_explanation": "The trimmed routine preserves all necessary logic, tool calls, and branches applicable to the customer's situation. All required calls like calculate_patient_responsibility, currency_exchange, fraud check, 3DS auth, process payment, issue receipt, and the prompt for a payment plan are present. The success/failure branches are handled correctly for each process, covering both credit card processing and offering a payment plan.",
