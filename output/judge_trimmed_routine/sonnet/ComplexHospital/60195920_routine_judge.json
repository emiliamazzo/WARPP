    "relevance_explanation": "The routine has been trimmed correctly, removing irrelevant branches based on the customer data, such as the suspended account path and the zero balance path. Extra tool calls have also been correctly pruned.",
    "completeness_score": "4",
    "completeness_explanation": "The routine is almost complete, but Step 5 has a success and a failure branch which both need to continue to Step 6. Step 6 should not be nested inside the conditional. Also, there is no conditional after the `get_insurance_payment_portion` tool call to handle `approved` vs `declined cases. The logic following a 'yes' response after being asked about a payment plan is also missing.",
