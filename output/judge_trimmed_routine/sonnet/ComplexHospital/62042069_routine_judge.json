    "relevance_explanation": "Step 1, Check Account Status, is not needed since the information from `check_account_status` tool is already used in step 2 of the full routine. Step 9 'Finalize' includes providing a confirmation number, there is no step to actually get or provide the confirmation number (tool or otherwise), so this step is unnecessary.",

    "completeness_explanation": "The routine is missing the offer of a payment plan in step 11 of the full routine. The customer has `payment_plan_active` as false, meaning the branch should be triggered. The success and error branches associated with the `check_wallet_payment_status` after processing the payment are missing in step 7b (failure would likely involve prompting the user to call the hotline and using complete_case()).",
