    "relevance_explanation": "The trimmed routine includes only steps relevant to the customer. Steps related to suspended accounts, zero balances, and fraud checks (credit card) are correctly removed, as they are not applicable to the customer's data.",
    "completeness_score": "4",
    "completeness_explanation": "The routine preserves most of the required logic based on the customer data. However, step 4 has a missing branch. The user is asked about a late fee waiver and calls `apply_fee_waiver` if they say yes. A corresponding negative branch is missing; it should direct the user to the calculate amount due step, step 5. Also, Step 10, providing the confirmation number, should occur before calling `complete_case`.",
