    "completeness_explanation": "Step 3 contains branches for approval and denial of financial assistance. Only one of these paths can happen. The routine should have separate steps for both paths. Same issue with Step 5 which handles the case where the customer doesn't want another currency. Also, the success branch after checking `check_wallet_payment_status` is missing.",
