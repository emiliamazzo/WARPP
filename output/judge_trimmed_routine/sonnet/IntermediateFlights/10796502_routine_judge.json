    "relevance_score": "3",
    "relevance_explanation": "The routine retains irrelevant steps. Specifically, the routine goes straight to 'Create Booking with Payment Method' even though it's conditional to the customer's payment method. Step 5, 'Error Handling and Resolution', is also kept, which doesn't need to be in the final trimmed routine.",
    "completeness_score": "3",
    "completeness_explanation": "The routine skips steps 5 and 6 related to passport and visa checks, which are essential for booking a flight ticket. Furthermore, Step 3 should be dependent on whether the customer opted for the points system or not. The original full routine does a \"points check\" before landing on step 9 (step 3 here). This part is missing.",
