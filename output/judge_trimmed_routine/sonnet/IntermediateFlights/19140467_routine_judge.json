    "relevance_explanation": "The routine was correctly trimmed to only include steps relevant to a frequent flyer customer paying with a credit card. Steps related to non-frequent flyers, passport information, visas, and points payments were removed.",
    "completeness_score": "3",
    "completeness_explanation": "The routine is missing essential steps related to checking passport information and retrieving the customer's payment method. Specifically, it omits step 5 ('Check Passport Information') and step 7 ('Retrieve Payment Method and Create Booking'). The call to `get_customer_payment_method_extra` in Step 7 is missing, which determines whether points or a credit card should be used. Step 6 is also missing, to check the Visa Requirements.",
