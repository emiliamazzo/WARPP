    "relevance_explanation": "The routine has been correctly trimmed to only include steps relevant to the customer, considering their available information such as the missing frequent flyer status to the existing Credit Card Payment method. Unnecessary steps like checking the customer's priority status (frequent flyer) and creating booking with points were removed, as the customer doesn't have frequent flyer status and doesn't pay with points.",
    "completeness_score": "4",
    "completeness_explanation": "The routine is almost complete. Step 5 from the original routine `Check Passport Information` is missing. This step is required since there is a passport number available in the customer data, so it doesn't need to ask the user. The call to `get_passport_info_extra(customer_id)` must be present",
