    "relevance_explanation": "The routine was correctly trimmed based on the customer's data. Since the customer is a platinum frequent flyer, the steps related to regular flight searches and visa requirements for non-frequent flyers were removed. Also, the passport check was removed since the system already had this information.",
    "completeness_score": "4",
    "completeness_explanation": "Step 5, 'Check Passport Information' should have been removed as the customer data contains passport information. However Step 3 skips over obtaining 'passport number', which is needed for create_booking. The routine does not retrieve customer payment method and just calls create_booking directly, therefore losing the logic for 'create_booking_with_points'.",
