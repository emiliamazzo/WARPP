    "relevance_explanation": "All branches and tool calls irrelevant to this customer were correctly removed. The customer data shows they have a booking that allows cancellations, does not have insurance, and is not refundable. The loyalty points branch was properly pruned. The routine also skips the refund step since the data indicates no refund is possible.",
    "completeness_score": "5",
    "completeness_explanation": "All required logic was preserved, including the proper tool calls, branches based on tool results, and handling for the customer's specific scenario. The selection of travel credit over refund was correctly applied.",
