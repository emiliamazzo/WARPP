    "relevance_score": "5",
    "relevance_explanation": "The routine correctly removed the steps and branches that were irrelevant to the customer based on their data. Because the customer has Gold frequent flyer status, the logic for non-frequent flyers was removed. Also, the passport and payment method information are present, so it does not ask the user for it.",
    "completeness_score": "4",
    "completeness_explanation": "Most of the required logic was preserved, but the 'Check Passport Information' step was skipped. The customer data indicates the customer has a passport number and therefore the step should have been skipped but included as 'Passport information is already on the system.'.",
