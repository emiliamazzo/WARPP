    "completeness_explanation": "The routine is missing step 5 (Check Passport Information) of the full routine. This tool call was required because the customer data contains passport information but is not inlined into the routine. Also it is missing Step 6 (Visa Information) and Step 7 (Retrieve Payment Method and Create Booking), though the payment method is already known.",
