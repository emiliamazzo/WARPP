    "relevance_explanation": "The routine has been correctly trimmed, removing irrelevant steps for non-frequent flyers, passport checks, visa information, and alternative payment methods. The logic now correctly reflects the steps required for a Platinum customer paying with points.",
    "completeness_score": "4",
    "completeness_explanation": "Step 5 from the original routine, Check Passport Information via `get_passport_info_extra(customer_id)`, was removed. This tool call was required since the customer data only shows that there is a passport number but doesn't give the value directly, making the tool call necessary to retrieve it. While passport information isn't explicitly required for booking with points, the routine states that all customers require a passport, so this is a required step.",
