    "relevance_explanation": "Step 2 in the original routine checks for frequent flyer status, but this customer does not have a status, so it skips to step 3 which searches for regular flights. In the trimmed routine, there is not a comparable step 2 and what was step 3 in the original routine becomes step 2 which calls the `search_regular_flights` tool. This is correct. However, Step 5 in the original routine calls `get_passport_info_extra(customer_id)` and if there is not a stored passport number, asks the user for it. The customer data provides passport info, so this value could have been inlined and the step skipped, but the lack of this step (plus the visa information step) means that `get_passport_info_extra(customer_id)` was not called when it should have been - and it was missed. Step 7 of the original routine calls `get_customer_payment_method_extra(customer_id)` which the data provides payment method. In the original routine, if the method is 'points', the routine moves to step 8; otherwise it skips to step 9 to `create_booking(flight_number)`. The customer data provides payment method as 'Debit Card' so this jumps to step 9 and eventually to step 10 that handles confirmation. In the trimmed routine, there is no equivalent (or inlined) payment processing step. The routine jumps instead to step 4 to `create_booking(flight_number)`. Thus, the trimmed routine misses steps.",
    "completeness_score": "3",
    "completeness_explanation": "The routine is missing a step to check for passport info, as well as payment method, from the original routine. Although the values are available from the customer data, they were skipped rather than inlined. Also, step 6 was skipped in the original routine, but should have been included in the trimmed routine: `check_visa_requirements(origin_airport, destination_airport)`. Step 3 in the trimmed routine performs the visa requirement check. The frequent flyer check was handled correctly, as the logic skips to the step for regular flights, rather than priority flights.",
