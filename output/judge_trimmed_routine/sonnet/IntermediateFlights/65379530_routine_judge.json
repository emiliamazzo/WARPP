    "relevance_explanation": "The routine is trimmed perfectly, removing irrelevant branches based on the customer data. The customer has less than 30,000 loyalty points, so the 'new customer' path is used. The booking allows cancellations, so the 'no cancellation' branch is removed. The customer purchased insurance, so we proceed to the process refund step.",
