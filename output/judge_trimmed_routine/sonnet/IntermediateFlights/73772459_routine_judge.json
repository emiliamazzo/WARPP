    "relevance_explanation": "The routine has been correctly trimmed to only include steps relevant to a Platinum frequent flyer, debit card user. Unnecessary branching based on frequent flyer status and visa requirements for non-frequent flyers has been removed. The payment method selection has also been correctly bypassed, and the routine proceeds directly to step 9 for debit card users.",

    "completeness_explanation": "The passport information check in the original step 5 was skipped. This step should have been transferred into the trimmed routine as is. All other required steps were preserved.",
