    "relevance_explanation": "The routine only includes logic relevant to the customer. The customer data shows they are not a preferred client (loyalty points < 30,000), so the 'preferred client' branch was correctly removed. Also, the initial check on cancellation policy was resolved, so that tool call was removed, and the logic flowed to the appropriate continuation.",
