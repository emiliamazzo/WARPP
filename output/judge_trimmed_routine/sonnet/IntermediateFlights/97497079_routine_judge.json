    "relevance_explanation": "The routine was correctly trimmed, removing irrelevant steps for non-frequent flyers and points-based payments. The logic correctly proceeds from flight details, to priority flight search (due to Gold status), skipping passport info (not required), and directly to create booking and final confirmation.",
    "completeness_score": "4",
    "completeness_explanation": "The step to retrieve the stored payment method was skipped, but is necessary to complete the purchase. The trimmed routine goes straight from priority flight search to booking, missing step 7 from the original routine. Passport information check was also removed, but may be required if the necessary information is not stored in our system.",
