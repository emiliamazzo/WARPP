    "relevance_explanation": "Step 1 from the original routine concerning checking withdrawal eligibility was removed which is correct given the customer data. However, the error handling section at the end seems unnecessarily detailed. The successful scenario following a withdrawal should proceed directly to step 4, Complete Case, the trimmed routine has created a nested looping system, which the customer will not be going through.",
    "completeness_score": "3",
    "completeness_explanation": "The routine is missing the initial check for withdrawal eligibility which, although resolved initially, should still be included as a check to prevent issues occurring later in the flow. Given that the customer is eligible, the flow continues linearly to withdrawal. If the withdrawal were to fail, the routine is designed to inform the withdrawal failed but no handling is given for the error. The routine should automatically retry the function and then terminate. The lack of handling for the error case means the action is incomplete.",
