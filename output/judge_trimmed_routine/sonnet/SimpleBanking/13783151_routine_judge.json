    "relevance_explanation": "The check withdrawal eligibility step was removed, which is correct since the customer data shows they are eligible. However, the error handling section is retained even though it's unlikely to be relevant. Ideally, only the success path would be retained after the `process_retirement_withdrawal` call.",
    "completeness_score": "4",
    "completeness_explanation": "The routine is mostly complete, but the success branch of `process_retirement_withdrawal` should not skip directly to step 4. Instead, the confirmation message from the success branch should be presented before proceeding to step 3, which calls `complete_case(...)`. Step 4 contains a redundant `complete_case(...)` call.",
