    "completeness_explanation": "Step 1 regarding checking withdrawal eligibility using `check_withdrawal_eligibility_extra` was skipped, even though the customer data indicates they are eligible. Even though they are eligible, that initial check should still be done before asking for withdrawal amount to confirm the result from the customer data. Additionally, the instruction to inform the customer upon failure to withdraw is missing from the primary success/failure branch of step 2. Finally, the confirmation message after calling complete_case is missing.",
