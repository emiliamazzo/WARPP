    "relevance_score": "4",
    "relevance_explanation": "The routine retains the error handling step which is technically relevant but could be considered a minor irrelevant fallback. The `check_withdrawal_eligibility` check and its negative branch were correctly removed due to the customer's data indicating eligibility. The step including 'Provide a confirmation message to the customer' is irrelevant since steps after `complete_case(...)` are not executed.",
    "completeness_score": "4",
    "completeness_explanation": "The routine is mostly complete. However, the original flow specified specifically handling the 'success' case of `process_retirement_withdrawal` before proceeding to the `complete_case` instruction. This success case is missing, and should have remained as part of the happy path.",
