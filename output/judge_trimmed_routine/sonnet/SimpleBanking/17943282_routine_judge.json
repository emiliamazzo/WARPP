However, the `client_level` check in step 4a was removed entirely instead of removing the negative branch. Since the `client_level` is standard, the `apply_address_hold` should still be called.",

    "completeness_explanation": "All necessary logic and tool calls for this customer were preserved, given that the `client_level` check was removed correctly (which it unfortunately wasn't, see relevance_score = 4).",
