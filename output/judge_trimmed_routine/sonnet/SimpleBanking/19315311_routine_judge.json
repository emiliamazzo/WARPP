    "relevance_explanation": "Step 4, Error Handling, should have been removed. The first three steps implement a successful interaction, and so error handling does not apply. Step 1 from the original routine was removed appropriately based on the customer data.",
    "completeness_score": "3",
    "completeness_explanation": "The trimmed routine is missing the initial eligibility check. While the customer data shows they *are* eligible (isEligible: true), the logic itself from the original routine must still be included. If eligibility check fails, the customer must be informed and the case closed. The routine also skips the if/else branch regarding success/failure of the withdrawal. While the success case is included, the failure/retry/inform steps are missing, except inside of the error handling, which I have marked as irrelevant.",
