    "relevance_explanation": "The routine retained the error handling logic, even though the customer data doesn't indicate an error. It's a minor point, but ideally, this would be removed or adapted to only handle errors specific to withdrawal processing rather than a generic \"any step fails\".",
    "completeness_score": "3",
    "completeness_explanation": "The most important omission stems from skipping the initial eligibility check, which resolves to `isEligible: true`. While it resolves favorably, the instruction and explicit tool call `check_withdrawal_eligibility_extra(customer_id)` and it's successful path/tool execution needed to be included, instead of pruning it entirely as resolved. Also, the original success confirmation by the tool `process_retirement_withdrawal` has an implicit success state check and should have been in an `if success:` block. The failure outcome of this tool also has a special instruction to proceed to step 4, which is odd and questionable given that step 4 already catches general errors. However, the trimming instruction says \"If failure: Inform the customer of the failure and proceed to step 4\" so must be maintained.",
