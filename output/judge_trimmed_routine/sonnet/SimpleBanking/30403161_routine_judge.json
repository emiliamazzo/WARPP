    "relevance_explanation": "The error handling section at the end is irrelevant as it includes logic related to retrying steps, which ideally should be handled elsewhere or in the individual steps themselves. It's not specific to this customer but rather a general fallback. The eligibility tool call was properly removed.",

    "completeness_explanation": "The success branch of `process_retirement_withdrawal` is missing. After a successful call, there should be a step that confirms success and shares the final amount with the customer. Also, it's unclear where the original step 4, which is a completion step, has been merged with. Without it, the routine looks incomplete. It seems like it got added to step 3, which shouldn't have been the case.",
