    "relevance_explanation": "The routine is mostly relevant. Step 1 from the original routine (`Check Withdrawal Eligibility`) was correctly removed because the customer data shows `isEligible` is true, thus removing the need for that check. However, the Error Handling block is retained despite the fact that specific error handling should be implemented in the tool blocks where they occur.",
    "completeness_score": "4",
    "completeness_explanation": "The routine is mostly complete, but it misses a critical success path. The `process_retirement_withdrawal` has a success branch. Currently, only the failure branch is fully implemented. The missing success branch confirmation should be included.",
