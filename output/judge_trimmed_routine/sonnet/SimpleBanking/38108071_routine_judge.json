    "completeness_explanation": "The step to check withdrawal eligibility using the `check_withdrawal_eligibility_extra` tool was not directly present in the trimmed routine, however, this omission is acceptable because the `isEligible` flag in the initial customer data eliminates the need for this step and has been properly accounted for. However, the routine is incomplete. The tool call `process_retirement_withdrawal` has both a success and failure condition. The failure condition just informs the customer of the failure and apologizes, but the original routine had an error handling section with a retry. That retry logic is missing. Also the success path skips providing a confirmation message after `complete_case(customer_id)`",
