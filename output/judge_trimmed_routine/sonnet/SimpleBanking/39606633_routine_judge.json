    "relevance_score": "4",
    "relevance_explanation": "The error handling step is irrelevant because the original routine immediately calls complete_case() after a withdrawal success. Thus the error handling logic should be removed. Also the withdrawal amount is not known in advance and needs to be asked for in the trimmed routine.",
    "completeness_score": "3",
    "completeness_explanation": "Step 1 from the original routine was removed, but the 'isEligible' value from `check_withdrawal_eligibility_extra` call is true. That branch should not have been removed. Also, the failure branch was kept in step 2, but the error handling step was included separate and after the complete_case(...) call.",
