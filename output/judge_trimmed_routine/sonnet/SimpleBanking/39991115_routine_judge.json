    "relevance_explanation": "The get_account_type_extra tool call was correctly removed and replaced with the account type directly. However, the logic for step 4, applying an address hold, should only be executed if the client level is STANDARD. The trimmed routine includes step 4 without checking the client level, making it not fully relevant. The client level is STANDARD, so the step is needed, but should be conditional.",
