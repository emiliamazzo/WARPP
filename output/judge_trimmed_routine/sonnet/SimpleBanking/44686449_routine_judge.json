    "completeness_explanation": "The routine is mostly complete, but the error handling/retry logic should not be a separate step, but rather within the Process Withdrawal step, if that step fails. The current structure means the error handling is outside of the context of the Process Withdrawal step and means that the error handling is misordered. Also the successful branch should not move onwards to step 3 - it has already confirmed success with the customer. The failure branch also moves onwards to step 4 (the existing error handling) when it should be step 3, which includes error handling.",
