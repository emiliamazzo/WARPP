    "completeness_explanation": "The first step of the original routine that calls `check_withdrawal_eligibility_extra(customer_id)` and the subsequent conditional logic were skipped. The customer data shows that the customer is eligible, so this tool call can be replaced with an inlined value. Failing to do so (and thus skipping the eligibility check entirely) is incomplete. Also, the 'If success' path after `process_retirement_withdrawal` is incomplete, it is missing one confirmation step that should have been retained.",
