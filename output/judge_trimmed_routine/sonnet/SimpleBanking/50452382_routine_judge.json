    "relevance_explanation": "The `get_account_type_extra` tool call in the original routine was correctly removed, and the account type was directly stated. However, step 6 'Error Handling' should have been removed. It is irrelevant to the successful execution of the trimmed steps and adds unnecessary complexity. Also, the `get_account_type_extra` tool call was used to also acquire the `client_level`, so step 4 should have logic to check the customer's client level before making the tool call.",

However, validation success and tool call successes do not contain success branches.",
