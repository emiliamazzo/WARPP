    "relevance_score": "4",
    "relevance_explanation": "The routine is mostly relevant. The call get_account_type_extra(customer_id) was replaced with the known account type. The error handling logic, while intended to cover failures, is a general fallback and, while not entirely irrelevant, it could be argued for removal as it's present in every trimmed routine. It's inclusion keeps it from being scored a 5. Also, the error handling is slightly repeated from the original, where it said to \"Retry once\" and in the trimmed routine it still says retry once which is somewhat redundant.",
    "completeness_score": "5",
    "completeness_explanation": "All required logic for the customer is present and preserved. The appropriate tool calls and conditional branches are retained.",
