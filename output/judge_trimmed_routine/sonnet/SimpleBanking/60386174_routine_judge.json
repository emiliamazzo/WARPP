However, the 'Error Handling' section (step 4) is still included. It should be completely removed as it's a fallback and the main steps should succeed for this customer. Additionally, the success/failure handling of the withdrawal tool call itself is technically relevant, but the error handling logic *again* in step 4 makes the routine feel less clean than it could be.\",\n  \"completeness_score\": \"4\",\n  \"completeness_explanation\": \"The trimmed routine is almost complete, as it includes collecting amount, processing withdrawal, and completing the case. However, there's a missing step that branches off from the 'Process Withdrawal' step. Specifically: 'Confirm success and share final amount with customer' is only included within the 'If success' block. It needs to be called *after* the 'If success' block finishes.\",\n}",
