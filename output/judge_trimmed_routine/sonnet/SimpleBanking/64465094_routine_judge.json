    "relevance_explanation": "The tool call get_account_type_extra(customer_id) was correctly removed and replaced with the resulting account type. The address hold step was correctly removed because it only applies to STANDARD level clients. However, the error handling section should also have been removed because it leads to a redundant `complete_case` call after the main `complete_case` call is made. Additionally, including the error handling retry loop isn't part of a usual trimming and is likely due to a misunderstanding.",

    "completeness_explanation": "All the necessary steps for the given customer type are preserved. The validation and update address steps are present as tool calls along with all necessary prompts and error handling within those steps.",
