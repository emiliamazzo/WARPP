    "relevance_explanation": "The initial check withdrawal eligibility call and its negative branch were correctly removed since the customer data shows that the customer *is* eligible. However, both the general error handling from the original routine was preserved when it should have been removed and the success branch for `process_retirement_withdrawal` doesn't terminate the case by calling `complete_case`, leading to multiple calls to the tool.",

    "completeness_explanation": "The routine is missing the initial check for withdrawal eligibility call and its negative branch that informed the customer and closed the case. The available information states that `isEligible` is `true`, so this would terminate the case, but the initial check is still a necessary step.",
