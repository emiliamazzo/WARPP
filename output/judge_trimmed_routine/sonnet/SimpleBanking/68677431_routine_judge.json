    "relevance_explanation": "Step 4 Error Handling should not be included. There's already error handling in step 2. Also, the check withdrawal eligibility step was removed, but the tool call `check_withdrawal_eligibility_extra(customer_id)` should have been removed from the available tools list.",
    "completeness_score": "4",
    "completeness_explanation": "The initial check withdrawal eligibility step was skipped because the customer is eligible. However, the success branch in step 2 should not proceed to step 3. It should call `complete_case` immediately after confirming success and sharing the final amount with the customer. Therefore step 3 should not be included within the main routine.",
