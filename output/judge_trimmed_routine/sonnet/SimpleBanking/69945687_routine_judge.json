    "relevance_explanation": "Step 1 from the original flow (Check Withdrawal Eligibility) was removed, however the eligibility check in step 1 of full routine is required and should have been inlined into the new routine (since customer_id is available). Instead the trimmed routines starts immediately asking for a withdrawal amount. Also, the error handling step 4 is not required as the step 2 already has error handling logic.",
    "completeness_score": "4",
    "completeness_explanation": "The trimmed routine skips the initial eligibility check, which should have been included since it determines if a withdrawal is even possible. While the data provided indicates they *are* eligible, the call to `check_withdrawal_eligibility` and confirmation must occur. The success output logic from step 3 in full routine is missing. Also, complete case tool called twice(Step 2 and Step 4). One of them should be removed.",
