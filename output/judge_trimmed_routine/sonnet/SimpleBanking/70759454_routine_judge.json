    "completeness_explanation": "The initial eligibility check using `check_withdrawal_eligibility_extra` was skipped, even though the customer data indicates they ARE eligible (`isEligible: true`). The trimmed routine proceeds directly to collecting the withdrawal amount, while the initial eligibility check should have been the first step. Additionally, the retry logic in Error Handling doesn't apply as it is already handled on Step 2.",
