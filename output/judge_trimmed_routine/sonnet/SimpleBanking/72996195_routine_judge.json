    "relevance_explanation": "Step 1 from the full routine was removed as it was not applicable to this customer, which is correct. However, the if/else logic in step 2 of the trimmed routine related to success or failure of `process_retirement_withdrawal` should not have been implemented, there was no instruction to add the success or failure logic, which now causes errors in the case to proceed as it says `proceed to step 4`, but step 4 is actually a step for error handling to retry once, thus should not have added.",
    "completeness_score": "3",
    "completeness_explanation": "The routine is missing the first step to check withdrawal eligibility which is stated in the instructions to check with `check_withdrawal_eligibility_extra(customer_id)`. It is determined to be true from the customer data (`isEligible: true`) but the prompt asks to include all logic, tools, and branches that apply to this customer. Since it is stated that they are eligible, it should just be represented in the routine text.",
