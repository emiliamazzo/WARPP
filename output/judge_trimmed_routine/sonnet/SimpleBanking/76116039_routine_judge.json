    "completeness_explanation": "The step that calls `get_account_type_extra(customer_id)` in the full routine was replaced with a direct value. All other logic appears to be followed, including the Apply Address Hold which is required for STANDARD clients. However, the `update_address` call should pass the collected address details, not static placeholders.",
