    "relevance_explanation": "Step 4, Error Handling, is retained even though the only listed tool, 'process_retirement_withdrawal', already handles failure logic within Step 2. The retry logic is superfluous. Step 1 `check_withdrawal_eligibility_extra` correctly removed, the customer data indicates 'isEligible': true.",
    "completeness_score": "4",
    "completeness_explanation": "The failure branch of `process_retirement_withdrawal` goes to step 4 (error handling) instead of step 3. According to the original routine, the failure branch in step two should have gone directly to the Error Handling section which has been labeled as Step 5. This would also mean that Step 3 would never occur if `process_retirement_withdrawal` fails and therefore would mean the customer would never hear about the error.",
