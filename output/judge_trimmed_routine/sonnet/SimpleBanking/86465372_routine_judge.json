    "relevance_score": "4",
    "relevance_explanation": "The routine is mostly relevant. However, error handling is included in step 4. This is unnecessary considering the routine should terminate at step 2 following a failure from the `process_retirement_withdrawal` call. Thus, after the negative response, it proceeds to step 4. Error handling would attempt a retry, which should not occur in this case.",
    "completeness_score": "3",
    "completeness_explanation": "The check withdrawal eligibility step was correctly removed because `isEligible` is true in the customer data. However, the success branch after the `process_retirement_withdrawal` is conditional but doesn't have a failure branch. The error handling is also missing a retry. The success case should also end the routine but instead goes to error handling.",
