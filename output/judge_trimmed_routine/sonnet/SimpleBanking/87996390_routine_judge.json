    "relevance_explanation": "The tool call `get_account_type_extra(customer_id)` was removed, which is correct because the account type is available in the customer data. However, the if/else block in step 4 should've been entirely removed given that the `client_level` is STANDARD, thus only the conditional logic under client_level = STANDARD should've been retained. Thus, the routine should have directly included `apply_address_hold` and the message about duration, not a conditional block.",
