    "relevance_explanation": "The trimmed routine only includes steps relevant to the customer. The `get_account_type_extra` call was removed as the `account_type` and `client_level` were provided in the customer data, and the account type was directly inlined. The address hold step was also correctly removed because the client level is PREMIUM, not STANDARD.",
    "completeness_score": "5",
    "completeness_explanation": "All necessary logic, tools, and branches that apply to this customer have been preserved. The `validate_address`, `update_address`, and `complete_case` tools were all retained along with the failure branch for address validation and the error handling steps which are applicable to all users.",
