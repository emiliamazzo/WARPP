    "relevance_explanation": "The step \"Check Withdrawal Eligibility\" and the associated conditional branch were removed, which is correct because the customer data shows the customer is eligible to withdraw, based on `\"isEligible\": true` in the customer data. However, the `check_withdrawal_eligibility_extra` tool call was omitted, which should have been inlined. Although eligibility evaluated to true, the tool itself should have been inlined before removing the check.",

    "completeness_explanation": "The primary logic for collecting withdrawal amount, processing it, completing the case, and error handling are all present. However, the success branch after `process_retirement_withdrawal` is missing the success message shared with the customer. The failure branch informs the customer of the failure, but there's no corresponding confirmation for the success case.",
