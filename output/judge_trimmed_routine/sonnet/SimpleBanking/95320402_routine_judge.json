It is never really specified that this needs to be removed unless there is no chance of the step failing. It is best to prune it to be completely sure about it even though there is no specific customer data that makes us think there is a failure. The initial eligibility check was properly removed from the routine given that the `isEligible` flag from the customer data is set to true and makes the first step completely irrelevant.\",\n  \"completeness_score\": \"3\",\n  \"completeness_explanation\": \"The routine misses the logic where checking the withdrawal eligibility happened. The response of calling the tool `check_withdrawal_eligibility_extra` returns a flag `isEligible: true`. Since it's true we proceed to ask about how much the user wants to withdraw from the account. This logic should be there. Specifically we need to include the step that checks if the customer is eligible for withdrawal. It only includes the question asked to the user, therefore the completeness score is low.\",\n}",
