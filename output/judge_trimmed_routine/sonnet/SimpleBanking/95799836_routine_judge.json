    "relevance_score": "4",
    "relevance_explanation": "The initial `check_withdrawal_eligibility` step was removed, which is appropriate given that the customer data indicates they are eligible. However, the error handling block at the end is unnecessary since the routine already terminates in the initial failure states of the process withdrawal tool. This error handling is a fallback that is irrelevant for this particular, simple case.",
    "completeness_score": "4",
    "completeness_explanation": "The routine is mostly complete. The success and failure branch for `process_retirement_withdrawal` were correctly included, but retry once block in the error handeling step has been removed. Since `process_retirement_withdrawal` may initially fail, it would make sense to keep the retry once block for it.",
