    "relevance_explanation": "The step `Call get_account_type_extra(customer_id)` was removed, which is correct since the account type is already available in the customer data and inlined later. However, step 4a `Apply Address Hold` was removed, but it should not have been. This step should be included for STANDARD client levels only, and it should be skipped otherwise. The current customer level is PREMIUM, so removing it is incorrect.",

    "completeness_explanation": "Step 4a was removed when it should exist to conditionally call `apply_address_hold(customer_id)` which is part of the original logic. Although the current client level prevents this logic from being executed, the scaffolding for this action should be present.",
