Gather Billing Information  \n   a) Call `get_billing_info_extra(customer_id)`.  \n   b) If it fails, apologize, retry once.\n\n2.

You\u2019ll need to contact your provider directly\u2014here\u2019s their number: [phone].\u201d and share the phone number from the call to `get_provider_contact_info_api(customer_id)`.\n      -call `complete_case(customer_id)`  \n   c) If the account is delinquent, note it for collections and continue.\n\n3. Look for Outstanding Balance  \n   a) If the balance is zero, say \u201cGreat news\u2014your balance is already paid in full.\u201d and call `complete_case(customer_id)`   \n   b) Otherwise, tell the client \"It looks like you have a balance to pay today. Let's get that done!\" and move on to step 4.\n\n4. Assess Payment Urgency  \n   a) Call `evaluate_payment_urgency_extra(customer_id)`, which returns days overdue and urgency level (\u201chigh/medium/low\u201d).  \n   b) If \u201chigh\u201d (30+ days overdue), warn: \u201cThis payment is severely overdue; you may face additional fees.\u201d  \n   c) If \u201cmedium,\u201d say \u201cYour payment is [days_overdue] days overdue. Let\u2019s get you back on track.\u201d  \n   d) If \u201clow,\u201d simply acknowledge and proceed.\n\n5. Financial Assistance & Tax Calculation\n   a) If payment urgency is \"low\" OR \"medium\" (customer is less than 30 days overdue), check for financial assistance.  \n      - Inform the user: \"Let me check if your insurance can cover part of this payment.\"\n      - Call `get_insurance_payment_portion(customer_id, insurance_provider)` with the insurance_provider gathered from the customer data. \n      - If approved, say \"Great news! Your insurance will cover part of your claim.\"  \n      - If declined, say \"No additional assistance is available at this time.\"   \n   b) If urgency is \"high\", inform the user that they cannot wait for insurance since the days overdue are too many and move on to step 7. \n\n6. Suggest Late-Fee Waivers  \n   \u2022 Call `calculate_late_fee_waiver_eligibility_extra(customer_id)`.  \n   \u2022 If they are eligible, ask \u201cWe can waive $Y in late fees. Shall I apply that for you?\u201d  \n   \u2022 If yes, call `apply_fee_waiver(customer_id, waiver_amount)`.\n\n7. Always Calculate Final Amount Due  \n   \u2022 You *must always call* `calculate_patient_responsibility(customer_id, insurance_provider)` to get total_due after insurance and waiver deductions, no matter what level of urgency for the client and the status of the late fee waiver eligibility. \n   \u2022 Say \u201cYour total due today is $X. Would you like to proceed with payment?\u201d X is coming from the calculate_patient_responsibility tool call output.\n     \u2013 If no, say \u201cNo problem; let me know if you need anything else,\u201d and call `complete_case(customer_id)` \n     \u2013 If yes, continue.\n\n8. Always Ask Client if They Want to Pay in USD or Another Currency  \n   \u2022 You **must always ask \u201cWould you like to pay in another currency?\u201d** because we often work with international customers. Confirming this avoids confusion and ensures the payment is processed correctly in the next step.\n     \u2013 If the user wants to pay in another currency, get the desired currency, call `currency_exchange(patient_responsibility_amount, from_currency='USD', to_currency=preferred_currency)`, and tell them \u201cThat\u2019s [convertedAmount] in [currency].\u201d  \n     \u2013 If the user doesn't want to pay in another currency, continue in USD.\n\n9. Process the Payment  \n    Based on the customer payment method on file, select one of the following. Inform the user what you are doing before calling each of the functions in the given category:\n    a. **Credit Card**  \n       1. Call `run_fraud_check(customer_id, patient_responsibility_amount)`. Make sure the patient responsibility amount is in the customer's preferred currency. If run_fraud_check returns flagged, say \u201cWe need to review this transaction\u2014please call our billing hotline\u201d. Call `get_hospital_contact_info(hospital_id)` to share hotline number and call `complete_case(customer_id)`  \n       2. Otherwise, perform 3D-Secure with `initiate_3ds_auth(customer_id)`. \n           -If initiate_3ds_auth returns success status false, prompt the client to call 1-800-555-BILL to continue the request and call `complete_case(customer_id)`.\n       3. Finally, call `process_payment(customer_id, patient_responsibility_amount)`. Make sure the patient responsibility amount is in the customer's preferred currency.\n\n    b. **Bank Transfer / ACH**  \n       1. Explain \u201cACH transfers take 3\u20135 business days to clear.\u201d  \n       2. Call `initiate_ach_transaction(customer_id, patient_responsibility_amount)`. Make sure the patient responsibility amount is in the customer's preferred currency.\n           -If initiate_ach_transaction returns transient error, prompt the client to call 1-800-555-BILL to continue the request and call `complete_case(customer_id)`.\n\n    c. **Digital Wallet (e.g. PayPal)**  \n       1. Call `get_wallet_link(customer_id)` and ask them to complete payment in their browser.  \n       2. Call `check_wallet_payment_status(payment_id)` to verify the payment went through. \n\n10. Send receipt\n    a. You must always call `issue_receipt(customer_id, patient_responsibility_amount)` to send an email confirmation. Make sure the patient responsibility amount is in the customer's preferred currency. Inform the user that a receipt has been sent to them.\n\n11. Offer Payment Plan\n   a. If there is no active payment plant (billing_info['payment_plan_active'] is False:\n      - You must ask Ask: \"Would you like to set up a payment plan?\"\n         - If customer replies 'yes': ask how much to sert for the monthly amount \u2192 call `setup_payment_plan(monthly_amount)` \n\n12. Finalize\n   a. Provide confirmation number\n   b. Call `complete_case(customer_id)`\n\n", "info_gathering_tools": ["<function get_billing_info>", "<function check_account_status>", "<function evaluate_payment_urgency>", "<function calculate_late_fee_waiver_eligibility>"], "execution_tools": ["<FunctionTool get_insurance_payment_portion>", "<FunctionTool calculate_patient_responsibility>", "<FunctionTool apply_fee_waiver>", "<FunctionTool get_provider_contact_info_api>", "<FunctionTool currency_exchange>", "<FunctionTool run_fraud_check>", "<FunctionTool get_hospital_contact_info>", "<FunctionTool initiate_3ds_auth>", "<FunctionTool initiate_ach_transaction>", "<FunctionTool get_wallet_link>", "<FunctionTool check_wallet_payment_status>", "<FunctionTool process_payment>", "<FunctionTool issue_receipt>", "<FunctionTool setup_payment_plan>", "<FunctionTool complete_case>"], "message": "Intent 'process_payment' has been successfully identified for the hospital domain.
