You haven't reached the minimum age required for penalty-free withdrawals.\n2. Your account type may have specific restrictions on withdrawals.\n3. You may not have met the required holding period for the funds.\n\nWhile I understand this may not be the news you were hoping for, it's important to maintain the integrity of your retirement savings and comply with applicable regulations.\n\nIf you'd like more information about your account status or to explore other financial options that might be available to you, I'd be happy to arrange a meeting with one of our financial advisors who can provide more detailed guidance.\n\nIs there anything else I can assist you with today regarding your account or other financial matters?", "user_perceived_latency": 4.83}, "timestamp": 1750748410.962104}
