## Final Personalized Routine

1. Retrieve Booking Information
   - Your fare permits cancellations—let’s now confirm whether operations still allow it.

2. Check Live Cancellation Blockers
   - Call `check_cancellation_blockers('BK004PQ4')`.
   - If response is:
     - "eligible": proceed
     - "api_failure": apologize to the client for the technical difficulties, prompt them to call again at a later time, and proceed directly to step 6.
     - any other response: inform the customer that there is a blocker that prevents them from cancelling the flight at this time. Offer an explanation, apologize, and proceed directly to step 6.

3. Calculate Cancellation Fee
   - Call `calculate_cancellation_fee(46927828, 'BK004PQ4')`.

4. Process Flight Cancellation
   - Describe policy + fee to the customer.
   - If the customer confirms, call `cancel_flight('BK004PQ4')`.

5. Process Refund
   - Call `process_refund(46927828, 'BK004PQ4', 'Debit Card', cancellation_fee)`.

6. Complete Case
   - Call `complete_case(46927828)`.
   - Thank the customer.
