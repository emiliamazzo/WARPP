## Final Personalized Routine

1. **Retrieve Customer Loyalty Information**
   - Welcome the customer as a preferred client since they have more than 30,000 loyalty points.

2. **Retrieve Booking Information**
   - Since the booking policy allows cancellations, acknowledge: “Your fare permits cancellations—let’s now confirm whether operations still allow it.”

3. **Check Live Cancellation Blockers**
   - Call `check_cancellation_blockers('BK007SN5')` to see if there are any blockers that prevent the cancellation.
   - If response is:
     - "eligible": proceed
     - "api_failure": apologize to the client for the technical difficulties, prompt them to call again at a later time, and proceed directly to step 8.
     - any other response: inform the customer that there is a blocker that prevents them from cancelling the flight at this time. Offer and explanation, apologize, and proceed directly to step 8.

4. **Calculate Cancellation Fee**
   - Call `calculate_cancellation_fee(72082639, 'BK007SN5')`

5. **Process Flight Cancellation**
   - Describe policy + fee to the customer.
   - If customer confirms, call `cancel_flight('BK007SN5')`

6. **Process Refund**
   - As the booking is refundable, call `process_refund(72082639, 'BK007SN5', 'Debit Card', cancellation_fee)`

7. **Confirm Cancellation and Provide Next Steps**
   - Share final status, refund amount, and confirmation number.

8. **Complete Case**
   - Call `complete_case(72082639)`
   - Thank the customer.
