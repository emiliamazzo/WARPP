## Final Personalized Routine

1. **Look for Outstanding Balance**  
   Tell the client "It looks like you have a balance to pay today. Let's get that done!"

2. **Assess Payment Urgency**  
   Warn: “This payment is severely overdue; you may face additional fees.”

3. **Suggest Late-Fee Waivers**  
   Ask “We can waive $9 in late fees. Shall I apply that for you?”  
   - If yes, call `apply_fee_waiver(19021760, 9)`.

4. **Always Calculate Final Amount Due**  
   Call `calculate_patient_responsibility(19021760, 'BluePeak')`.  
   Say “Your total due today is $X. Would you like to proceed with payment?”
   - If no, say “No problem; let me know if you need anything else,” and call `complete_case(19021760)`
   - If yes, continue.

5. **Always Ask Client if They Want to Pay in USD or Another Currency**  
   Ask “Would you like to pay in another currency?”  
   - If yes, get the desired currency, call `currency_exchange(patient_responsibility_amount, from_currency='USD', to_currency=preferred_currency)`, and say “That’s [convertedAmount] in [currency].”  
   - If no, continue in USD.

6. **Process the Payment**  
   - Call `get_wallet_link(19021760)` and ask them to complete payment in their browser.  
   - Call `check_wallet_payment_status(payment_id)` to verify the payment went through. 

7. **Send Receipt**  
   Call `issue_receipt(19021760, patient_responsibility_amount)`.  
   Inform the user that a receipt has been sent to them.

8. **Finalize**  
   Provide confirmation number.  
   Call `complete_case(19021760)`
