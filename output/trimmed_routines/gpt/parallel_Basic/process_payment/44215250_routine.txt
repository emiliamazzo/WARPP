## Final Personalized Routine

1. Gather Billing Information
   - Call `get_billing_info_extra(44215250)`.
   - If it fails, apologize, retry once.

2. Check Account Status
   - The account is active, continue.

3. Look for Outstanding Balance
   - Say "It looks like you have a balance to pay today. Let's get that done!" and move on to the next step.

4. Assess Payment Urgency
   - Days overdue: 30, urgency level: "high".
   - Warn: “This payment is severely overdue; you may face additional fees.”

5. Suggest Late-Fee Waivers
   - Call `calculate_late_fee_waiver_eligibility_extra(44215250)`.
   - If eligible, ask “We can waive $1 in late fees. Shall I apply that for you?”
     - If yes, call `apply_fee_waiver(44215250, 1)`.

6. Always Calculate Final Amount Due
   - Call `calculate_patient_responsibility(44215250, 'Cignexa')` to get total_due after insurance and waiver deductions.
   - Say “Your total due today is $X. Would you like to proceed with payment?”
     - If no, say “No problem; let me know if you need anything else,” and call `complete_case(44215250)`.
     - If yes, continue.

7. Always Ask Client if They Want to Pay in USD or Another Currency
   - Ask “Would you like to pay in another currency?”
     - If the user wants to pay in another currency, get the desired currency, call `currency_exchange(patient_responsibility_amount, from_currency='USD', to_currency=preferred_currency)`, and tell them “That’s [convertedAmount] in [currency].”
     - If the user doesn't want to pay in another currency, continue in USD.

8. Process the Payment
   - **Bank Transfer / ACH**
     - Explain “ACH transfers take 3–5 business days to clear.”
     - Call `initiate_ach_transaction(44215250, patient_responsibility_amount)`.
       - If initiate_ach_transaction returns transient error, prompt the client to call 1-800-555-BILL to continue the request and call `complete_case(44215250)`.

9. Send Receipt
   - Call `issue_receipt(44215250, patient_responsibility_amount)` to send an email confirmation. Inform the user that a receipt has been sent to them.

10. Offer Payment Plan
    - Since there is no active payment plan:
      - Ask: "Would you like to set up a payment plan?"
      - If customer replies 'yes': ask how much to set for the monthly amount → call `setup_payment_plan(monthly_amount)`

11. Finalize
    - Provide confirmation number.
    - Call `complete_case(44215250)`.
