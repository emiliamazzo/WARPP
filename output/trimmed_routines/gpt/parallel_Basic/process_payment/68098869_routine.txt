**Final Personalized Routine**

1. Check Account Status
   - The account is active.

2. Look for Outstanding Balance
   - Tell the client "It looks like you have a balance to pay today. Let's get that done!"

3. Assess Payment Urgency
   - This payment is severely overdue; you may face additional fees.

4. Suggest Late-Fee Waivers
   - Call `calculate_late_fee_waiver_eligibility_extra(68098869)`.
   - If they are eligible, ask “We can waive $6 in late fees. Shall I apply that for you?”
      - If yes, call `apply_fee_waiver(68098869, 6)`.

5. Calculate Final Amount Due
   - You must always call `calculate_patient_responsibility(68098869, 'Cignexa')` to get total_due after insurance and waiver deductions.
   - Say “Your total due today is $X. Would you like to proceed with payment?”
     - If no, say “No problem; let me know if you need anything else,” and call `complete_case(68098869)`.
     - If yes, continue.

6. Ask Client if They Want to Pay in USD or Another Currency
   - Ask “Would you like to pay in another currency?”
     - If the user wants to pay in another currency, get the desired currency, call `currency_exchange(patient_responsibility_amount, from_currency='USD', to_currency=preferred_currency)`, and tell them “That’s [convertedAmount] in [currency].”
     - If the user doesn't want to pay in another currency, continue in USD.

7. Process the Payment
   - Call `run_fraud_check(68098869, patient_responsibility_amount)`.
     - If flagged, say “We need to review this transaction—please call our billing hotline”. Call `get_hospital_contact_info(665303)` to share hotline number and call `complete_case(68098869)`.
     - Otherwise, call `initiate_3ds_auth(68098869)`.
       - If initiate_3ds_auth returns success status false, prompt the client to call 1-800-555-BILL to continue the request and call `complete_case(68098869)`.
   - Call `process_payment(68098869, patient_responsibility_amount)`.

8. Send receipt
   - Call `issue_receipt(68098869, patient_responsibility_amount)` to send an email confirmation. Inform the user that a receipt has been sent to them.

9. Offer Payment Plan
   - Ask "Would you like to set up a payment plan?"
     - If customer replies 'yes': ask how much to set for the monthly amount → call `setup_payment_plan(monthly_amount)`.

10. Finalize
   - Call `complete_case(68098869)`.
