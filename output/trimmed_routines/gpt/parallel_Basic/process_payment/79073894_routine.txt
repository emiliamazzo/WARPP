## Final Personalized Routine

1. Gather Billing Information  
   - Call `get_billing_info_extra(customer_id)`.
   - If it fails, apologize and retry once.

2. Check Account Status  
   - The account is suspended.
   - Call `get_provider_contact_info_api(customer_id)`.
   - Say, “Your account is currently suspended. You’ll need to contact your provider directly—here’s their number: [phone].”
   - Call `complete_case(79073894)`.
