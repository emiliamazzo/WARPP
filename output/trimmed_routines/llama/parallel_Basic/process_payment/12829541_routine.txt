**Final Personalized Routine**


1. Gather Billing Information
The account is active.

2. Look for Outstanding Balance
It looks like you have a balance to pay today. Let's get that done!

3. Assess Payment Urgency
Your payment is 17 days overdue. Let's get you back on track.

4. Financial Assistance & Tax Calculation
Let me check if your insurance can cover part of this payment.
Call `get_insurance_payment_portion(12829541, 'BluePeak')`.
If approved, say "Great news! Your insurance will cover part of your claim."
If declined, say "No additional assistance is available at this time."

5. Suggest Late-Fee Waivers
We can waive $13 in late fees. Shall I apply that for you?
Call `apply_fee_waiver(12829541, 13)`.

6. Always Calculate Final Amount Due
Call `calculate_patient_responsibility(12829541, 'BluePeak')`.
Say “Your total due today is $X. Would you like to proceed with payment?”
– If no, say “No problem; let me know if you need anything else,” and call `complete_case(12829541)`
– If yes, continue.

7. Always Ask Client if They Want to Pay in Another Currency
Would you like to pay in another currency?
– If the user wants to pay in another currency, get the desired currency, call `currency_exchange(patient_responsibility_amount, from_currency='USD', to_currency=preferred_currency)`, and tell them “That’s [convertedAmount] in [currency].”
– If the user doesn't want to pay in another currency, continue in USD.

8. Process the Payment
Call `run_fraud_check(12829541, patient_responsibility_amount)`.
Make sure the patient responsibility amount is in the customer's preferred currency. If run_fraud_check returns flagged, say “We need to review this transaction—please call our billing hotline”. Call `get_hospital_contact_info(291018)` to share hotline number and call `complete_case(12829541)`.
Otherwise, perform 3D-Secure with `initiate_3ds_auth(12829541)`.
– If initiate_3ds_auth returns success status false, prompt the client to call 1-800-555-BILL to continue the request and call `complete_case(12829541)`.
Finally, call `process_payment(12829541, patient_responsibility_amount)`. Make sure the patient responsibility amount is in the customer's preferred currency.

9. Send receipt
Call `issue_receipt(12829541, patient_responsibility_amount)` to send an email confirmation. Make sure the patient responsibility amount is in the customer's preferred currency. Inform the user that a receipt has been sent to them.

10. Offer Payment Plan
Would you like to set up a payment plan?
– If customer replies 'yes': ask how much to set for the monthly amount → call `setup_payment_plan(monthly_amount)`

11. Finalize
Provide confirmation number
Call `complete_case(12829541)`
