**Final Personalized Routine**:
1. Gather Billing Information  
   The account is active, the balance is $385, and payment is 36 days overdue.

2. Check Account Status  
   The account is active.

3. Look for Outstanding Balance  
   It looks like you have a balance to pay today. Let's get that done!

4. Assess Payment Urgency  
   This payment is severely overdue; you may face additional fees.

5. Process the Payment  
   Since you have a Credit Card as your payment method, we'll process the payment accordingly.  
   a) Call `run_fraud_check(13178975, patient_responsibility_amount)`.  
   b) If run_fraud_check returns flagged, say “We need to review this transaction—please call our billing hotline” and call `get_hospital_contact_info(351960)` to share hotline number and call `complete_case(13178975)`.  
   c) Otherwise, perform 3D-Secure with `initiate_3ds_auth(13178975)`.  
       - If initiate_3ds_auth returns success status false, prompt the client to call 1-800-555-BILL to continue the request and call `complete_case(13178975)`.  
   d) Finally, call `process_payment(13178975, patient_responsibility_amount)`.

6. Always Ask Client if They Want to Pay in Another Currency  
   Would you like to pay in another currency?  
   – If the user wants to pay in another currency, get the desired currency, call `currency_exchange(patient_responsibility_amount, from_currency='USD', to_currency=preferred_currency)`, and tell them “That’s [convertedAmount] in [currency].”  
   – If the user doesn't want to pay in another currency, continue in USD.

7. Calculate Final Amount Due  
   Call `calculate_patient_responsibility(13178975, 'BluePeak')` to get total_due after insurance and waiver deductions.  
   Say “Your total due today is $X. Would you like to proceed with payment?” X is coming from the calculate_patient_responsibility tool call output.  
   – If no, say “No problem; let me know if you need anything else,” and call `complete_case(13178975)`.  
   – If yes, continue.

8. Send Receipt  
   Call `issue_receipt(13178975, patient_responsibility_amount)` to send an email confirmation.

9. Offer Payment Plan  
   Would you like to set up a payment plan?  
   – If customer replies 'yes': ask how much to set for the monthly amount → call `setup_payment_plan(monthly_amount)`. 

10. Finalize  
   Provide confirmation number  
   Call `complete_case(13178975)`.
