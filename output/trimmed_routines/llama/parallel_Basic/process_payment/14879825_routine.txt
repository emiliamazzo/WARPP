**Final Personalized Routine**
1. Gather Billing Information
   The customer ID is 14879825.

2. Check Account Status
   The account is active.

3. Look for Outstanding Balance
   It looks like you have a balance to pay today. Let's get that done!

4. Assess Payment Urgency
   This payment is severely overdue; you may face additional fees.

5. Always Calculate Final Amount Due
   Call `calculate_patient_responsibility(14879825, 'Humena')` to get total_due after insurance and waiver deductions.
   Say “Your total due today is $X. Would you like to proceed with payment?” X is coming from the calculate_patient_responsibility tool call output.
     – If no, say “No problem; let me know if you need anything else,” and call `complete_case(14879825)` 
     – If yes, continue.

6. Always Ask Client if They Want to Pay in USD or Another Currency
   You **must always ask “Would you like to pay in another currency?”** because we often work with international customers. Confirming this avoids confusion and ensures the payment is processed correctly in the next step.
     – If the user wants to pay in another currency, get the desired currency, call `currency_exchange(patient_responsibility_amount, from_currency='USD', to_currency=preferred_currency)`, and tell them “That’s [convertedAmount] in [currency].”  
     – If the user doesn't want to pay in another currency, continue in USD.

7. Process the Payment
   a) **Credit Card**  
       1. Call `run_fraud_check(14879825, patient_responsibility_amount)`. Make sure the patient responsibility amount is in the customer's preferred currency. If run_fraud_check returns flagged, say “We need to review this transaction—please call our billing hotline”. Call `get_hospital_contact_info(450489)` to share hotline number and call `complete_case(14879825)`  
       2. Otherwise, perform 3D-Secure with `initiate_3ds_auth(14879825)`. 
           -If initiate_3ds_auth returns success status false, prompt the client to call 1-800-555-BILL to continue the request and call `complete_case(14879825)`.
       3. Finally, call `process_payment(14879825, patient_responsibility_amount)`. Make sure the patient responsibility amount is in the customer's preferred currency.

8. Send receipt
   a) You must always call `issue_receipt(14879825, patient_responsibility_amount)` to send an email confirmation. Make sure the patient responsibility amount is in the customer's preferred currency. Inform the user that a receipt has been sent to them.

9. Offer Payment Plan
   a. Ask: "Would you like to set up a payment plan?"
         - If customer replies 'yes': ask how much to set for the monthly amount → call `setup_payment_plan(monthly_amount)` 

10. Finalize
   a. Provide confirmation number
   b. Call `complete_case(14879825)`
