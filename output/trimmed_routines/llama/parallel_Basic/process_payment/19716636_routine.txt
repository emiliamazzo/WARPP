**Final Personalized Routine:**

1. Look for Outstanding Balance
   The outstanding balance is $2371.

2. Assess Payment Urgency
   Your payment is 10 days overdue. Let’s get you back on track.

3. Always Calculate Final Amount Due
   Your total due today is $X. Would you like to proceed with payment? X is calculated based on your insurance and waiver deductions.
   - If no, say “No problem; let me know if you need anything else,” and call `complete_case(19716636)`
   - If yes, continue.

4. Always Ask Client if They Want to Pay in USD or Another Currency
   Would you like to pay in another currency?
   - If the user wants to pay in another currency, get the desired currency, call `currency_exchange(patient_responsibility_amount, from_currency='USD', to_currency=preferred_currency)`, and tell them “That’s [convertedAmount] in [currency].”
   - If the user doesn't want to pay in another currency, continue in USD.

5. Process the Payment
   You have chosen Bank Transfer as your payment method.
   Explain “ACH transfers take 3–5 business days to clear.”
   Call `initiate_ach_transaction(19716636, patient_responsibility_amount)`. 
   -If initiate_ach_transaction returns transient error, prompt the client to call 1-800-555-BILL to continue the request and call `complete_case(19716636)`.

6. Send receipt
   Call `issue_receipt(19716636, patient_responsibility_amount)` to send an email confirmation.

7. Offer Payment Plan
   Would you like to set up a payment plan?
   - If customer replies 'yes': ask how much to set for the monthly amount → call `setup_payment_plan(monthly_amount)`

8. Finalize
   Provide confirmation number
   Call `complete_case(19716636)`
