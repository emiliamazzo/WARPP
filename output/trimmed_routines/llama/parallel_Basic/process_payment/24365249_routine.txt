**Final Personalized Routine**
1. Look for Outstanding Balance  
   The balance is $1193. Tell the client "It looks like you have a balance to pay today. Let's get that done!"

2. Assess Payment Urgency  
   The payment is 27 days overdue, which is medium urgency. Say “Your payment is 27 days overdue. Let’s get you back on track.”

3. Always Calculate Final Amount Due  
   • Call `calculate_patient_responsibility(24365249, 'BluePeak')` to get total_due after insurance deductions. 
   • Say “Your total due today is $X. Would you like to proceed with payment?” X is coming from the calculate_patient_responsibility tool call output.
     – If no, say “No problem; let me know if you need anything else,” and call `complete_case(24365249)` 
     – If yes, continue.

4. Always Ask Client if They Want to Pay in USD or Another Currency  
   • Ask “Would you like to pay in another currency?” 
     – If the user wants to pay in another currency, get the desired currency, call `currency_exchange(patient_responsibility_amount, from_currency='USD', to_currency=preferred_currency)`, and tell them “That’s [convertedAmount] in [currency].”  
     – If the user doesn't want to pay in another currency, continue in USD.

5. Process the Payment  
   Since the client's payment method is Credit Card, 
   a) Call `run_fraud_check(24365249, patient_responsibility_amount)`. Make sure the patient responsibility amount is in the customer's preferred currency. If run_fraud_check returns flagged, say “We need to review this transaction—please call our billing hotline”. Call `get_hospital_contact_info(284047)` to share hotline number and call `complete_case(24365249)`  
   b) Otherwise, perform 3D-Secure with `initiate_3ds_auth(24365249)`. 
       -If initiate_3ds_auth returns success status false, prompt the client to call 1-800-555-BILL to continue the request and call `complete_case(24365249)`.
   c) Finally, call `process_payment(24365249, patient_responsibility_amount)`. Make sure the patient responsibility amount is in the customer's preferred currency.

6. Send receipt
   a) Call `issue_receipt(24365249, patient_responsibility_amount)` to send an email confirmation. Make sure the patient responsibility amount is in the customer's preferred currency. Inform the user that a receipt has been sent to them.

7. Finalize
   a) Provide confirmation number
   b) Call `complete_case(24365249)`
