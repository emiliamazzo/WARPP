**Final Personalized Routine**
1. Gather Billing Information
   Call `get_billing_info_extra(customer_id)`.

2. Check Account Status
   The account is delinquent, note it for collections and continue.

3. Look for Outstanding Balance
   Tell the client "It looks like you have a balance to pay today. Let's get that done!"

4. Assess Payment Urgency
   Your payment is 11 days overdue. Let's get you back on track.

5. Financial Assistance & Tax Calculation
   Inform the user: "Let me check if your insurance can cover part of this payment."
   Call `get_insurance_payment_portion(customer_id, insurance_provider)` with the insurance_provider gathered from the customer data. 
   If approved, say "Great news! Your insurance will cover part of your claim."  
   If declined, say "No additional assistance is available at this time."   

6. Always Calculate Final Amount Due  
   *Must always call* `calculate_patient_responsibility(customer_id, insurance_provider)` to get total_due after insurance and waiver deductions, no matter what level of urgency for the client and the status of the late fee waiver eligibility. 
   Say “Your total due today is $X. Would you like to proceed with payment?” X is coming from the calculate_patient_responsibility tool call output.
     – If no, say “No problem; let me know if you need anything else,” and call `complete_case(customer_id)` 
     – If yes, continue.

7. Always Ask Client if They Want to Pay in USD or Another Currency  
   **Must always ask “Would you like to pay in another currency?”** because we often work with international customers. Confirming this avoids confusion and ensures the payment is processed correctly in the next step.
     – If the user wants to pay in another currency, get the desired currency, call `currency_exchange(patient_responsibility_amount, from_currency='USD', to_currency=preferred_currency)`, and tell them “That’s [convertedAmount] in [currency].”  
     – If the user doesn't want to pay in another currency, continue in USD.

8. Process the Payment  
   Inform the user what you are doing before calling each of the functions in the given category:
   Since the payment method is Digital Wallet, 
   Call `get_wallet_link(customer_id)` and ask them to complete payment in their browser.  
   Call `check_wallet_payment_status(payment_id)` to verify the payment went through. 

9. Send receipt  
   *Must always call* `issue_receipt(customer_id, patient_responsibility_amount)` to send an email confirmation. Make sure the patient responsibility amount is in the customer's preferred currency. Inform the user that a receipt has been sent to them.

10. Offer Payment Plan  
   Ask: "Would you like to set up a payment plan?"
      - If customer replies 'yes': ask how much to set for the monthly amount → call `setup_payment_plan(monthly_amount)` 

11. Finalize  
   Provide confirmation number
   Call `complete_case(customer_id)`
