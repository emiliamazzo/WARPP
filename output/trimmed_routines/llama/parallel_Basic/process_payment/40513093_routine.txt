**Final Personalized Routine**
1. You have a balance of $1357.
2. Since your account status is active, let's proceed.
3. You are "medium" urgency, 14 days overdue. Let's get you back on track.
4. Let me check if your insurance can cover part of this payment.
    * Call `get_insurance_payment_portion(customer_id, insurance_provider)`.  
    * If approved, say "Great news! Your insurance will cover part of your claim."  
    * If declined, say "No additional assistance is available at this time."
5. We can waive $13 in late fees. Shall I apply that for you?
    * If yes, call `apply_fee_waiver(customer_id, waiver_amount)`.
6. Your total due today is $X. Would you like to proceed with payment? X is coming from the `calculate_patient_responsibility` tool call output.
    * If no, say “No problem; let me know if you need anything else,” and call `complete_case(customer_id)`.
    * If yes, continue.
7. Would you like to pay in another currency?
    * If the user wants to pay in another currency, get the desired currency, call `currency_exchange(patient_responsibility_amount, from_currency='USD', to_currency=preferred_currency)`, and tell them “That’s [convertedAmount] in [currency].”
    * If the user doesn't want to pay in another currency, continue in USD.
8. Process the payment using Bank Transfer:
    * Explain “ACH transfers take 3–5 business days to clear.”  
    * Call `initiate_ach_transaction(customer_id, patient_responsibility_amount)`. Make sure the patient responsibility amount is in the customer's preferred currency.
    * If initiate_ach_transaction returns transient error, prompt the client to call 1-800-555-BILL to continue the request and call `complete_case(customer_id)`.
9. Send receipt:
    * You must always call `issue_receipt(customer_id, patient_responsibility_amount)` to send an email confirmation. Make sure the patient responsibility amount is in the customer's preferred currency. Inform the user that a receipt has been sent to them.
10. Offer Payment Plan:
    * Ask: "Would you like to set up a payment plan?"
    * If customer replies 'yes': ask how much to set for the monthly amount → call `setup_payment_plan(monthly_amount)`
11. Finalize:
    * Provide confirmation number
    * Call `complete_case(customer_id)`
