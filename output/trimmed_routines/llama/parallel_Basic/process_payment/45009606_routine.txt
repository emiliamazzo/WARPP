**Final Personalized Routine**

1. The account is delinquent. 
2. Look for Outstanding Balance  
    It looks like you have a balance to pay today. Let's get that done!
3. Assess Payment Urgency  
    This payment is severely overdue; you may face additional fees.
4. Always Calculate Final Amount Due  
    You *must always call* `calculate_patient_responsibility(customer_id, insurance_provider)` to get total_due after insurance and waiver deductions.
    Your total due today is $X. Would you like to proceed with payment? 
    – If no, say “No problem; let me know if you need anything else,” and call `complete_case(customer_id)` 
    – If yes, continue.
5. Always Ask Client if They Want to Pay in USD or Another Currency  
    Would you like to pay in another currency? 
    – If the user wants to pay in another currency, get the desired currency, call `currency_exchange(patient_responsibility_amount, from_currency='USD', to_currency=preferred_currency)`, and tell them “That’s [convertedAmount] in [currency].”  
    – If the user doesn't want to pay in another currency, continue in USD.
6. Process the Payment  
    Since your payment method is Digital Wallet, I will guide you through the payment process.
    Call `get_wallet_link(customer_id)` and ask them to complete payment in their browser.  
    Call `check_wallet_payment_status(payment_id)` to verify the payment went through.
7. Send receipt  
    You must always call `issue_receipt(customer_id, patient_responsibility_amount)` to send an email confirmation.
    Inform the user that a receipt has been sent to them.
8. Finalize  
    Provide confirmation number
    Call `complete_case(customer_id)`
