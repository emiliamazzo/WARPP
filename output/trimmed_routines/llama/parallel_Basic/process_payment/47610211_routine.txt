**Final Personalized Routine**:
1. Gather Billing Information
   The account status is delinquent.

2. Check Account Status
   The account is delinquent, note it for collections and continue.

3. Look for Outstanding Balance
   It looks like you have a balance to pay today. Let's get that done!

4. Assess Payment Urgency
   This payment is severely overdue; you may face additional fees.

5. Financial Assistance & Tax Calculation
   Unfortunately, you cannot wait for insurance since the days overdue are too many.

6. Suggest Late-Fee Waivers
   We can waive $4 in late fees. Shall I apply that for you?
   - If yes, call `apply_fee_waiver(customer_id, 4)`
   - If no, proceed.

7. Always Calculate Final Amount Due
   Call `calculate_patient_responsibility(47610211, 'BluePeak')` to get total_due after insurance and waiver deductions.
   Say “Your total due today is $X. Would you like to proceed with payment?”
   - If no, say “No problem; let me know if you need anything else,” and call `complete_case(47610211)`
   - If yes, continue.

8. Always Ask Client if They Want to Pay in Another Currency
   Would you like to pay in another currency?
   - If yes, get the desired currency, call `currency_exchange(patient_responsibility_amount, from_currency='USD', to_currency=preferred_currency)`, and tell them “That’s [convertedAmount] in [currency].”
   - If no, continue in USD.

9. Process the Payment
   Call `get_wallet_link(47610211)` and ask them to complete payment in their browser.
   Call `check_wallet_payment_status(payment_id)` to verify the payment went through.

10. Send receipt
    Call `issue_receipt(47610211, patient_responsibility_amount)` to send an email confirmation.

11. Offer Payment Plan
    Would you like to set up a payment plan?
    - If yes, ask how much to set for the monthly amount → call `setup_payment_plan(monthly_amount)`

12. Finalize
   Provide confirmation number
   Call `complete_case(47610211)`
