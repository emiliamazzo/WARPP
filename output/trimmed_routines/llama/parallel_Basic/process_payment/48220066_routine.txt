**Final Personalized Routine**
1. Look for Outstanding Balance
   The balance is $2414. Let's get that done!

2. Assess Payment Urgency
   Your payment is 3 days overdue. Let's get you back on track.

3. Always Calculate Final Amount Due
   Call `calculate_patient_responsibility(customer_id, 'Humena')`. 
   Say “Your total due today is $X. Would you like to proceed with payment?” 
   - If no, say “No problem; let me know if you need anything else,” and call `complete_case(customer_id)` 
   - If yes, continue.

4. Always Ask Client if They Want to Pay in USD or Another Currency
   You **must always ask “Would you like to pay in another currency?”**. 
   - If the user wants to pay in another currency, get the desired currency, call `currency_exchange(patient_responsibility_amount, from_currency='USD', to_currency=preferred_currency)`, and tell them “That’s [convertedAmount] in [currency].”  
   - If the user doesn't want to pay in another currency, continue in USD.

5. Process the Payment
   Since the payment method is Digital Wallet, call `get_wallet_link(customer_id)` and ask them to complete payment in their browser.  
   Call `check_wallet_payment_status(payment_id)` to verify the payment went through.

6. Send receipt
   Call `issue_receipt(customer_id, patient_responsibility_amount)` to send an email confirmation.

7. Offer Payment Plan
   Ask: "Would you like to set up a payment plan?"
   - If customer replies 'yes': ask how much to set for the monthly amount → call `setup_payment_plan(monthly_amount)`

8. Finalize
   Provide confirmation number
   Call `complete_case(customer_id)`
