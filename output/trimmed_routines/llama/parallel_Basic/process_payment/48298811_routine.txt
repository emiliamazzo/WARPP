4. Process the Payment
   You are set up to pay with Digital Wallet.
   Call `get_wallet_link(customer_id)` and ask them to complete payment in their browser.
   Call `check_wallet_payment_status(payment_id)` to verify the payment went through.

5. Send Receipt
   You must always call `issue_receipt(customer_id, patient_responsibility_amount)` to send an email confirmation.
   Inform the user that a receipt has been sent to them.

6. Offer Payment Plan
   Would you like to set up a payment plan?
   - If customer replies 'yes': ask how much to set for the monthly amount â†’ call `setup_payment_plan(monthly_amount)`

7. Finalize
   Provide confirmation number
   Call `complete_case(customer_id)`
