**Final Personalized Routine**
1. Gather Billing Information  
   The customer has an outstanding balance of 586.

2. Check Account Status  
   The account is active, so we'll proceed.

3. Look for Outstanding Balance  
   It looks like you have a balance to pay today. Let's get that done!

4. Assess Payment Urgency  
   The payment is severely overdue; you may face additional fees.

5. Financial Assistance & Tax Calculation  
   Since the urgency is high, we cannot wait for insurance to cover part of this payment.

6. Suggest Late-Fee Waivers  
   We can waive $13 in late fees. Shall I apply that for you?  
   • If yes, call `apply_fee_waiver(customer_id, waiver_amount)`.
   • If no, proceed to step 7.

7. Always Calculate Final Amount Due  
   Call `calculate_patient_responsibility(customer_id, insurance_provider)` to get total_due after insurance and waiver deductions.
   Say “Your total due today is $X. Would you like to proceed with payment?” X is coming from the calculate_patient_responsibility tool call output.
   – If no, say “No problem; let me know if you need anything else,” and call `complete_case(customer_id)`.
   – If yes, continue.

8. Always Ask Client if They Want to Pay in USD or Another Currency  
   Would you like to pay in another currency?
   – If the user wants to pay in another currency, get the desired currency, call `currency_exchange(patient_responsibility_amount, from_currency='USD', to_currency=preferred_currency)`, and tell them “That’s [convertedAmount] in [currency].”
   – If the user doesn't want to pay in another currency, continue in USD.

9. Process the Payment  
   Since the payment method is Digital Wallet, call `get_wallet_link(customer_id)` and ask them to complete payment in their browser.
   Call `check_wallet_payment_status(payment_id)` to verify the payment went through.

10. Send receipt  
    Call `issue_receipt(customer_id, patient_responsibility_amount)` to send an email confirmation.

11. Offer Payment Plan  
    Ask: "Would you like to set up a payment plan?"
    – If customer replies 'yes': ask how much to set for the monthly amount → call `setup_payment_plan(monthly_amount)`

12. Finalize  
    Provide confirmation number
    Call `complete_case(customer_id)`
