**Final Personalized Routine**
1. Gather Billing Information  
The account is active, the balance is $482, and payment is 2 days overdue.

2. Look for Outstanding Balance  
It looks like you have a balance to pay today. Let's get that done!

3. Assess Payment Urgency  
Your payment is 2 days overdue. Let’s get you back on track.

4. Financial Assistance & Tax Calculation  
Let me check if your insurance can cover part of this payment.
Call `get_insurance_payment_portion(51651269, 'Aetralis')`.
- If approved, say "Great news! Your insurance will cover part of your claim."
- If declined, say "No additional assistance is available at this time."

5. Suggest Late-Fee Waivers  
We can waive $1 in late fees. Shall I apply that for you?  
- If yes, call `apply_fee_waiver(51651269, 1)`.

6. Always Calculate Final Amount Due  
Call `calculate_patient_responsibility(51651269, 'Aetralis')` to get total_due after insurance and waiver deductions.  
Say “Your total due today is $X. Would you like to proceed with payment?” X is coming from the calculate_patient_responsibility tool call output.
- If no, say “No problem; let me know if you need anything else,” and call `complete_case(51651269)` 
- If yes, continue.

7. Always Ask Client if They Want to Pay in USD or Another Currency  
Would you like to pay in another currency?  
- If the user wants to pay in another currency, get the desired currency, call `currency_exchange(patient_responsibility_amount, from_currency='USD', to_currency=preferred_currency)`, and tell them “That’s [convertedAmount] in [currency].”  
- If the user doesn't want to pay in another currency, continue in USD.

8. Process the Payment  
Explain “ACH transfers take 3–5 business days to clear.”  
Call `initiate_ach_transaction(51651269, patient_responsibility_amount)`. Make sure the patient responsibility amount is in the customer's preferred currency.
- If initiate_ach_transaction returns transient error, prompt the client to call 1-800-555-BILL to continue the request and call `complete_case(51651269)`.

9. Send receipt
Call `issue_receipt(51651269, patient_responsibility_amount)` to send an email confirmation. Make sure the patient responsibility amount is in the customer's preferred currency. Inform the user that a receipt has been sent to them.

10. Offer Payment Plan
Would you like to set up a payment plan?  
- If yes, ask how much to set for the monthly amount → call `setup_payment_plan(monthly_amount)` 

11. Finalize
Provide confirmation number
Call `complete_case(51651269)`
