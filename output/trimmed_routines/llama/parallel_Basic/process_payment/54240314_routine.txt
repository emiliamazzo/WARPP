**Final Personalized Routine**

1. Gather Billing Information
   a) Note: The account is delinquent.

2. Look for Outstanding Balance
   a) Tell the client "It looks like you have a balance to pay today. Let's get that done!"

3. Assess Payment Urgency
   a) Say "Your payment is 16 days overdue. Let's get you back on track."

4. Calculate Final Amount Due
   a) Call `calculate_patient_responsibility(54240314, 'BluePeak')` to get total_due after insurance and waiver deductions.
   b) Say “Your total due today is $X. Would you like to proceed with payment?” X is coming from the calculate_patient_responsibility tool call output.
     – If no, say “No problem; let me know if you need anything else,” and call `complete_case(54240314)` 
     – If yes, continue.

5. Process the Payment
    a) Explain “ACH transfers take 3–5 business days to clear.”  
    b) Call `initiate_ach_transaction(54240314, patient_responsibility_amount)`. 
       -If initiate_ach_transaction returns transient error, prompt the client to call 1-800-555-BILL to continue the request and call `complete_case(54240314)`.

6. Send receipt
    a) You must always call `issue_receipt(54240314, patient_responsibility_amount)` to send an email confirmation.
