**Final Personalized Routine**

1. Gather Billing Information  
The customer ID is 59398125. 

2. Check Account Status  
The account is active.

3. Look for Outstanding Balance  
It looks like you have a balance to pay today. Let's get that done!

4. Assess Payment Urgency  
This payment is severely overdue; you may face additional fees.

5. Financial Assistance & Tax Calculation
We cannot wait for insurance since the days overdue are too many and move on to step 7.

6. Always Calculate Final Amount Due  
Call `calculate_patient_responsibility(59398125, 'Humena')` to get total_due after insurance and waiver deductions. 
Say “Your total due today is $X. Would you like to proceed with payment?” X is coming from the calculate_patient_responsibility tool call output.
– If no, say “No problem; let me know if you need anything else,” and call `complete_case(59398125)` 
– If yes, continue.

7. Process the Payment  
Based on the customer payment method on file, select one of the following. Inform the user what you are doing before calling each of the functions in the given category:
**Credit Card**  
Call `run_fraud_check(59398125, patient_responsibility_amount)`. Make sure the patient responsibility amount is in the customer's preferred currency. If run_fraud_check returns flagged, say “We need to review this transaction—please call our billing hotline”. Call `get_hospital_contact_info(634529)` to share hotline number and call `complete_case(59398125)`  
Otherwise, perform 3D-Secure with `initiate_3ds_auth(59398125)`. 
–If initiate_3ds_auth returns success status false, prompt the client to call 1-800-555-BILL to continue the request and call `complete_case(59398125)`.
Finally, call `process_payment(59398125, patient_responsibility_amount)`. Make sure the patient responsibility amount is in the customer's preferred currency.

8. Ask Client if They Want to Pay in Another Currency  
You **must always ask “Would you like to pay in another currency?”** because we often work with international customers. Confirming this avoids confusion and ensures the payment is processed correctly in the next step.
– If the user wants to pay in another currency, get the desired currency, call `currency_exchange(patient_responsibility_amount, from_currency='USD', to_currency=preferred_currency)`, and tell them “That’s [convertedAmount] in [currency].”  
– If the user doesn't want to pay in another currency, continue in USD.

9. Send Receipt  
Call `issue_receipt(59398125, patient_responsibility_amount)` to send an email confirmation. Make sure the patient responsibility amount is in the customer's preferred currency. Inform the user that a receipt has been sent to them.

10. Offer Payment Plan  
Ask: "Would you like to set up a payment plan?"
– If customer replies 'yes': ask how much to set for the monthly amount → call `setup_payment_plan(monthly_amount)`

11. Finalize  
Provide confirmation number
Call `complete_case(59398125)`
