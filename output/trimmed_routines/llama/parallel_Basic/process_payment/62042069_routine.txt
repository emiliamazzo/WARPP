**Final Personalized Routine**
1. The account is delinquent and 42 days overdue.
2. Since the balance is not zero, tell the client "It looks like you have a balance to pay today. Let's get that done!"
3. This payment is severely overdue; you may face additional fees.
4. Your total due today is $X. Would you like to proceed with payment?
   - If no, say “No problem; let me know if you need anything else,” and call `complete_case(customer_id)` 
   - If yes, continue.
5. Would you like to pay in another currency?
   - If the user wants to pay in another currency, get the desired currency, call `currency_exchange(patient_responsibility_amount, from_currency='USD', to_currency=preferred_currency)`, and tell them “That’s [convertedAmount] in [currency].”  
   - If the user doesn't want to pay in another currency, continue in USD.
6. Process the Payment  
   Call `get_wallet_link(customer_id)` and ask them to complete payment in their browser.  
   Call `check_wallet_payment_status(payment_id)` to verify the payment went through. 
7. Send receipt
   Call `issue_receipt(customer_id, patient_responsibility_amount)` to send an email confirmation.
8. Finalize
   a. Provide confirmation number
   b. Call `complete_case(customer_id)`
