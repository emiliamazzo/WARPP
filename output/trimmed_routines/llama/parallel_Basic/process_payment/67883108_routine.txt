**Final Personalized Routine**
1. Gather Billing Information
   a) The account is active, and the balance is $1652.

2. Look for Outstanding Balance
   b) Tell the client "It looks like you have a balance to pay today. Let's get that done!"

3. Assess Payment Urgency
   c) Say “Your payment is 13 days overdue. Let’s get you back on track.”

4. Financial Assistance & Tax Calculation
   a) Inform the user: "Let me check if your insurance can cover part of this payment."
   b) Call `get_insurance_payment_portion(67883108, insurance_provider)` with the insurance_provider gathered from the customer data.
   c) If approved, say "Great news! Your insurance will cover part of your claim."
   d) If declined, say "No additional assistance is available at this time."

5. Suggest Late-Fee Waivers
   a) If they are eligible, ask “We can waive $6 in late fees. Shall I apply that for you?”
   b) If yes, call `apply_fee_waiver(67883108, 6)`

6. Always Calculate Final Amount Due
   a) You *must always call* `calculate_patient_responsibility(67883108, 'Cignexa')` to get total_due after insurance and waiver deductions.
   b) Say “Your total due today is $X. Would you like to proceed with payment?” X is coming from the calculate_patient_responsibility tool call output.
     – If no, say “No problem; let me know if you need anything else,” and call `complete_case(67883108)` 
     – If yes, continue.

7. Process the Payment
   c) **Digital Wallet (e.g. PayPal)**
       1. Call `get_wallet_link(67883108)` and ask them to complete payment in their browser.
       2. Call `check_wallet_payment_status(payment_id)` to verify the payment went through.

8. Send receipt
   a) You must always call `issue_receipt(67883108, patient_responsibility_amount)` to send an email confirmation. Make sure the patient responsibility amount is in the customer's preferred currency. Inform the user that a receipt has been sent to them.

9. Offer Payment Plan
   a) Ask: "Would you like to set up a payment plan?"
      – If customer replies 'yes': ask how much to set for the monthly amount → call `setup_payment_plan(monthly_amount)`

   b) Call `complete_case(67883108)`
