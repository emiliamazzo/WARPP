**Final Personalized Routine**
1. Gather Billing Information
   The account is active.

2. Look for Outstanding Balance
   You have a balance to pay today. Let's get that done!

3. Assess Payment Urgency
   Your payment is 20 days overdue. Let's get you back on track.

4. Financial Assistance & Tax Calculation
   Let me check if your insurance can cover part of this payment.
   Call `get_insurance_payment_portion(customer_id, insurance_provider)`.
   If approved, say "Great news! Your insurance will cover part of your claim."
   If declined, say "No additional assistance is available at this time."

5. Suggest Late-Fee Waivers
   We can waive $11 in late fees. Shall I apply that for you?
   If yes, call `apply_fee_waiver(customer_id, 11)`.

6. Always Calculate Final Amount Due
   Call `calculate_patient_responsibility(customer_id, insurance_provider)` to get total_due after insurance and waiver deductions.
   Say “Your total due today is $X. Would you like to proceed with payment?”
   – If no, say “No problem; let me know if you need anything else,” and call `complete_case(customer_id)`
   – If yes, continue.

7. Always Ask Client if They Want to Pay in USD or Another Currency
   Would you like to pay in another currency?
   – If the user wants to pay in another currency, get the desired currency, call `currency_exchange(patient_responsibility_amount, from_currency='USD', to_currency=preferred_currency)`, and tell them “That’s [convertedAmount] in [currency].”
   – If the user doesn't want to pay in another currency, continue in USD.

8. Process the Payment
   Since your payment method is Bank Transfer, I'll guide you through the process.
   Explain “ACH transfers take 3–5 business days to clear.”
   Call `initiate_ach_transaction(customer_id, patient_responsibility_amount)`.
   If initiate_ach_transaction returns transient error, prompt the client to call 1-800-555-BILL to continue the request and call `complete_case(customer_id)`.

9. Send receipt
   Call `issue_receipt(customer_id, patient_responsibility_amount)` to send an email confirmation.

10. Offer Payment Plan
    Would you like to set up a payment plan?
    – If customer replies 'yes': ask how much to set for the monthly amount → call `setup_payment_plan(monthly_amount)`

11. Finalize
    Provide confirmation number
    Call `complete_case(customer_id)`
