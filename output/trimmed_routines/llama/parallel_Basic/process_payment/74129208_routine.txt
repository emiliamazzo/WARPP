**Final Personalized Routine**

1. Gather Billing Information  
The customer ID is 74129208. 

2. Check Account Status  
The account is active. 

3. Look for Outstanding Balance  
It looks like you have a balance to pay today. Let's get that done! 

4. Assess Payment Urgency  
Your payment is 26 days overdue. Let's get you back on track. 

5. Process the Payment  
You will be paying with Credit Card. 
   a) Call `run_fraud_check(74129208, patient_responsibility_amount)`. 
   If run_fraud_check returns flagged, say “We need to review this transaction—please call our billing hotline”. Call `get_hospital_contact_info(658241)` to share hotline number and call `complete_case(74129208)`.  
   Otherwise, perform 3D-Secure with `initiate_3ds_auth(74129208)`. 
   If initiate_3ds_auth returns success status false, prompt the client to call 1-800-555-BILL to continue the request and call `complete_case(74129208)`. 
   Finally, call `process_payment(74129208, patient_responsibility_amount)`. 

6. Always Calculate Final Amount Due  
Your total due today is $X. Would you like to proceed with payment? X is coming from the `calculate_patient_responsibility(74129208, 'Aetralis')` tool call output. 
   – If no, say “No problem; let me know if you need anything else,” and call `complete_case(74129208)` 
   – If yes, continue. 

7. Always Ask Client if They Want to Pay in USD or Another Currency  
Would you like to pay in another currency? 
   – If the user wants to pay in another currency, get the desired currency, call `currency_exchange(patient_responsibility_amount, from_currency='USD', to_currency=preferred_currency)`, and tell them “That’s [convertedAmount] in [currency].” 
   – If the user doesn't want to pay in another currency, continue in USD. 

8. Send Receipt  
You must always call `issue_receipt(74129208, patient_responsibility_amount)` to send an email confirmation. 

9. Offer Payment Plan  
Would you like to set up a payment plan? 
   – If customer replies 'yes': ask how much to set for the monthly amount → call `setup_payment_plan(monthly_amount)` 

10. Finalize  
Provide confirmation number
Call `complete_case(74129208)`
