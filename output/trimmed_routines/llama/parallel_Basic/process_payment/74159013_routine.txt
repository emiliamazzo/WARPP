**Final Personalized Routine**
1. Look for Outstanding Balance
   The outstanding balance is $56.

2. Assess Payment Urgency
   The payment urgency is high since it is 41 days overdue. This payment is severely overdue; you may face additional fees.

3. Always Calculate Final Amount Due
   Call `calculate_patient_responsibility(74159013, 'Cignexa')` to get total_due after insurance and waiver deductions.
   Say “Your total due today is $X. Would you like to proceed with payment?” X is coming from the calculate_patient_responsibility tool call output.
     – If no, say “No problem; let me know if you need anything else,” and call `complete_case(74159013)`
     – If yes, continue.

4. Always Ask Client if They Want to Pay in USD or Another Currency
   You **must always ask “Would you like to pay in another currency?”** because we often work with international customers. Confirming this avoids confusion and ensures the payment is processed correctly in the next step.
     – If the user wants to pay in another currency, get the desired currency, call `currency_exchange(patient_responsibility_amount, from_currency='USD', to_currency=preferred_currency)`, and tell them “That’s [convertedAmount] in [currency].”
     – If the user doesn't want to pay in another currency, continue in USD.

5. Process the Payment
   Since the payment method is Credit Card:
   Call `run_fraud_check(74159013, patient_responsibility_amount)`. Make sure the patient responsibility amount is in the customer's preferred currency. If run_fraud_check returns flagged, say “We need to review this transaction—please call our billing hotline”. Call `get_hospital_contact_info(178013)` to share hotline number and call `complete_case(74159013)` 
   Otherwise, perform 3D-Secure with `initiate_3ds_auth(74159013)`. 
       -If initiate_3ds_auth returns success status false, prompt the client to call 1-800-555-BILL to continue the request and call `complete_case(74159013)`.
   Finally, call `process_payment(74159013, patient_responsibility_amount)`. Make sure the patient responsibility amount is in the customer's preferred currency.

6. Send receipt
   You must always call `issue_receipt(74159013, patient_responsibility_amount)` to send an email confirmation. Make sure the patient responsibility amount is in the customer's preferred currency. Inform the user that a receipt has been sent to them.

7. Offer Payment Plan
   If there is no active payment plan (billing_info['payment_plan_active'] is False):
      Ask: "Would you like to set up a payment plan?"
         - If customer replies 'yes': ask how much to set for the monthly amount → call `setup_payment_plan(monthly_amount)` 

8. Finalize
   a. Provide confirmation number
   b. Call `complete_case(74159013)`
