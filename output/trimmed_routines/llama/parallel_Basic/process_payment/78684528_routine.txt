**Final Personalized Routine**
1. Gather Billing Information  
   Note: The customer has an outstanding balance of $2302.

2. Check Account Status  
   The account is delinquent, so note it for collections and continue.

3. Look for Outstanding Balance  
   It looks like you have a balance to pay today. Let's get that done!

4. Assess Payment Urgency  
   Your payment is 0 days overdue. Let's get you back on track.

5. Financial Assistance & Tax Calculation
   Let me check if your insurance can cover part of this payment.
   Call `get_insurance_payment_portion(customer_id, 'Humena')`. 
   If approved, say "Great news! Your insurance will cover part of your claim."  
   If declined, say "No additional assistance is available at this time." 

6. Always Calculate Final Amount Due  
   Call `calculate_patient_responsibility(customer_id, 'Humena')` to get total_due after insurance deductions. 
   Say “Your total due today is $X. Would you like to proceed with payment?” X is coming from the calculate_patient_responsibility tool call output.
     – If no, say “No problem; let me know if you need anything else,” and call `complete_case(customer_id)` 
     – If yes, continue.

7. Always Ask Client if They Want to Pay in USD or Another Currency  
   Would you like to pay in another currency? 
     – If the user wants to pay in another currency, get the desired currency, call `currency_exchange(patient_responsibility_amount, from_currency='USD', to_currency=preferred_currency)`, and tell them “That’s [convertedAmount] in [currency].”  
     – If the user doesn't want to pay in another currency, continue in USD.

8. Process the Payment  
   Explain “ACH transfers take 3–5 business days to clear.”  
   Call `initiate_ach_transaction(customer_id, patient_responsibility_amount)`. Make sure the patient responsibility amount is in the customer's preferred currency.
       -If initiate_ach_transaction returns transient error, prompt the client to call 1-800-555-BILL to continue the request and call `complete_case(customer_id)`.

9. Send receipt  
   Call `issue_receipt(customer_id, patient_responsibility_amount)` to send an email confirmation. Make sure the patient responsibility amount is in the customer's preferred currency. Inform the user that a receipt has been sent to them.

10. Finalize
   Provide confirmation number
   Call `complete_case(customer_id)`.
