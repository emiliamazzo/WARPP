**Final Personalized Routine**
1. Check Account Status
   The account is delinquent, note it for collections.

2. Look for Outstanding Balance
   It looks like you have a balance to pay today. Let's get that done!

3. Assess Payment Urgency
   Your payment is 23 days overdue. Let's get you back on track.

4. Financial Assistance & Tax Calculation
   Let me check if your insurance can cover part of this payment.
   Call `get_insurance_payment_portion(82829378, 'Humena')`.
   If approved, say "Great news! Your insurance will cover part of your claim."
   If declined, say "No additional assistance is available at this time."

5. Suggest Late-Fee Waivers
   We can waive $9 in late fees. Shall I apply that for you?
   If yes, call `apply_fee_waiver(82829378, 9)`.

6. Always Calculate Final Amount Due
   Call `calculate_patient_responsibility(82829378, 'Humena')` to get total_due after insurance and waiver deductions.
   Say “Your total due today is $X. Would you like to proceed with payment?”
   – If no, say “No problem; let me know if you need anything else,” and call `complete_case(82829378)` 
   – If yes, continue.

7. Always Ask Client if They Want to Pay in USD or Another Currency
   Would you like to pay in another currency?
   – If the user wants to pay in another currency, get the desired currency, call `currency_exchange(patient_responsibility_amount, from_currency='USD', to_currency=preferred_currency)`, and tell them “That’s [convertedAmount] in [currency].”  
   – If the user doesn't want to pay in another currency, continue in USD.

8. Process the Payment
   Since the customer payment method is Credit Card:
   1. Call `run_fraud_check(82829378, patient_responsibility_amount)`.  
   2. Otherwise, perform 3D-Secure with `initiate_3ds_auth(82829378)`.
       -If initiate_3ds_auth returns success status false, prompt the client to call 1-800-555-BILL to continue the request and call `complete_case(82829378)`.
   3. Finally, call `process_payment(82829378, patient_responsibility_amount)`.

9. Send receipt
   Call `issue_receipt(82829378, patient_responsibility_amount)` to send an email confirmation.

10. Offer Payment Plan
   If there is no active payment plant (billing_info['payment_plan_active'] is False):
   Ask: "Would you like to set up a payment plan?"
   – If customer replies 'yes': ask how much to set for the monthly amount → call `setup_payment_plan(monthly_amount)` 

11. Finalize
   Provide confirmation number
   Call `complete_case(82829378)`.
