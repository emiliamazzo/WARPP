**Final Personalized Routine**

1. Gather Billing Information  
The account is active, and the outstanding balance is $846.

2. Look for Outstanding Balance  
It looks like you have a balance to pay today. Let's get that done!

3. Assess Payment Urgency  
Your payment is 11 days overdue. Let’s get you back on track.

4. Always Calculate Final Amount Due  
Call `calculate_patient_responsibility(87167057, 'BluePeak')` to get total_due.  
Say “Your total due today is $X. Would you like to proceed with payment?” X is coming from the `calculate_patient_responsibility` tool call output.
     – If no, say “No problem; let me know if you need anything else,” and call `complete_case(87167057)`
     – If yes, continue.

5. Always Ask Client if They Want to Pay in USD or Another Currency  
Would you like to pay in another currency?  
     – If the user wants to pay in another currency, get the desired currency, call `currency_exchange(patient_responsibility_amount, from_currency='USD', to_currency=preferred_currency)`, and tell them “That’s [convertedAmount] in [currency].”  
     – If the user doesn't want to pay in another currency, continue in USD.

6. Process the Payment  
Call `get_wallet_link(87167057)` and ask them to complete payment in their browser.  
Call `check_wallet_payment_status(payment_id)` to verify the payment went through.

7. Send receipt  
Call `issue_receipt(87167057, patient_responsibility_amount)` to send an email confirmation.

8. Offer Payment Plan  
Would you like to set up a payment plan?  
     – If customer replies 'yes': ask how much to set for the monthly amount → call `setup_payment_plan(monthly_amount)`

9. Finalize  
Provide confirmation number  
Call `complete_case(87167057)`
