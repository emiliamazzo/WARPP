**Final Personalized Routine**
1. Look for Outstanding Balance
   The outstanding balance is $2089. Let's get that done!

2. Assess Payment Urgency
   Your payment is 17 days overdue. Let's get you back on track.

3. Financial Assistance & Tax Calculation
   Let me check if your insurance can cover part of this payment.
   Call `get_insurance_payment_portion(customer_id, 'Aetralis')`.
   If approved, say "Great news! Your insurance will cover part of your claim."
   If declined, say "No additional assistance is available at this time."

4. Suggest Late-Fee Waivers
   We can waive $11 in late fees. Shall I apply that for you?
   If yes, call `apply_fee_waiver(customer_id, 11)`.

5. Always Calculate Final Amount Due
   Call `calculate_patient_responsibility(customer_id, 'Aetralis')` to get total_due after insurance and waiver deductions.
   Say “Your total due today is $X. Would you like to proceed with payment?” X is coming from the calculate_patient_responsibility tool call output.
     – If no, say “No problem; let me know if you need anything else,” and call `complete_case(customer_id)`
     – If yes, continue.

6. Payment Processing
   Since your preferred payment method is Bank Transfer, let's proceed with that.
   Explain “ACH transfers take 3–5 business days to clear.”
   Call `initiate_ach_transaction(customer_id, total_due)`.
       -If initiate_ach_transaction returns transient error, prompt the client to call 1-800-555-BILL to continue the request and call `complete_case(customer_id)`.

7. Send receipt
   Call `issue_receipt(customer_id, total_due)` to send an email confirmation.

8. Offer Payment Plan
   Would you like to set up a payment plan?
       - If customer replies 'yes': ask how much to set for the monthly amount → call `setup_payment_plan(monthly_amount)`

9. Finalize
   Provide confirmation number
   Call `complete_case(customer_id)`
