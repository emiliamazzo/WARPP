1. **Final Personalized Routine**:

1. Outstanding Balance
   The balance is $1123. Tell the client "It looks like you have a balance to pay today. Let's get that done!"

2. Payment Urgency
   The urgency is high and the payment is 35 days overdue. Warn: "This payment is severely overdue; you may face additional fees."

3. Calculate Final Amount Due
   Call `calculate_patient_responsibility(14879825, 'Humena')` to get total_due after insurance deductions.
   Say "Your total due today is $X. Would you like to proceed with payment?" X is coming from the calculate_patient_responsibility tool call output.
   - If no, say "No problem; let me know if you need anything else," and call `complete_case(14879825)`
   - If yes, continue.

4. Ask Client about Currency
   Ask "Would you like to pay in another currency?"
   - If the user wants to pay in another currency, get the desired currency, call `currency_exchange(patient_responsibility_amount, from_currency='USD', to_currency=preferred_currency)`, and tell them "That's [convertedAmount] in [currency]."
   - If the user doesn't want to pay in another currency, continue in USD.

5. Process the Payment (Credit Card)
   a. Inform the user that you will be processing the payment via credit card.
   b. Call `run_fraud_check(14879825, patient_responsibility_amount)`. Make sure the patient responsibility amount is in the customer's preferred currency. 
      - If run_fraud_check returns flagged, say "We need to review this transaction—please call our billing hotline". Call `get_hospital_contact_info(450489)` to share hotline number and call `complete_case(14879825)`
      - Otherwise, continue to next step.
   c. Perform 3D-Secure with `initiate_3ds_auth(14879825)`.
      - If initiate_3ds_auth returns success status false, prompt the client to call 1-800-555-BILL to continue the request and call `complete_case(14879825)`.
      - Otherwise, continue to next step.
   d. Call `process_payment(14879825, patient_responsibility_amount)`. Make sure the patient responsibility amount is in the customer's preferred currency.

6. Send Receipt
   Call `issue_receipt(14879825, patient_responsibility_amount)` to send an email confirmation. Make sure the patient responsibility amount is in the customer's preferred currency. Inform the user that a receipt has been sent to them.

7. Offer Payment Plan
   Ask: "Would you like to set up a payment plan?"
   - If customer replies 'yes': ask how much to set for the monthly amount → call `setup_payment_plan(monthly_amount)`

8. Finalize
