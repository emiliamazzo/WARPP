1. **Final Personalized Routine**:

1. Look for Outstanding Balance
   The balance is $1357. Tell the client "It looks like you have a balance to pay today. Let's get that done!"

2. Assess Payment Urgency
   The payment urgency is medium and 14 days overdue. Say "Your payment is 14 days overdue. Let's get you back on track."

3. Financial Assistance & Tax Calculation
   Inform the user: "Let me check if your insurance can cover part of this payment."
   Call `get_insurance_payment_portion(40513093, 'BluePeak')`.
   - If approved, say "Great news! Your insurance will cover part of your claim."
   - If declined, say "No additional assistance is available at this time."

4. Suggest Late-Fee Waivers
   The client is eligible for a waiver. Ask "We can waive $13 in late fees. Shall I apply that for you?"
   - If yes, call `apply_fee_waiver(40513093, 13)`.

5. Calculate Final Amount Due
   Call `calculate_patient_responsibility(40513093, 'BluePeak')` to get total_due after insurance and waiver deductions.
   Say "Your total due today is $X. Would you like to proceed with payment?" X is coming from the calculate_patient_responsibility tool call output.
   – If no, say "No problem; let me know if you need anything else," and call `complete_case(40513093)`
   – If yes, continue.

6. Ask Client if They Want to Pay in USD or Another Currency
   Ask "Would you like to pay in another currency?"
   – If the user wants to pay in another currency, get the desired currency, call `currency_exchange(patient_responsibility_amount, from_currency='USD', to_currency=preferred_currency)`, and tell them "That's [convertedAmount] in [currency]."
   – If the user doesn't want to pay in another currency, continue in USD.

7. Process the Payment
   Inform the user that you will initiate a bank transfer.
   Explain "ACH transfers take 3–5 business days to clear."
   Call `initiate_ach_transaction(40513093, patient_responsibility_amount)`. Make sure the patient responsibility amount is in the customer's preferred currency.
   - If initiate_ach_transaction returns transient error, prompt the client to call 1-800-555-BILL to continue the request and call `complete_case(40513093)`.

8. Send receipt
   Call `issue_receipt(40513093, patient_responsibility_amount)` to send an email confirmation. Make sure the patient responsibility amount is in the customer's preferred currency. Inform the user that a receipt has been sent to them.

9. Offer Payment Plan
   Ask: "Would you like to set up a payment plan?"
   - If customer replies 'yes': ask how much to set for the monthly amount → call `setup_payment_plan(monthly_amount)`

10. Finalize
    Provide confirmation number
    Call `complete_case(40513093)`
