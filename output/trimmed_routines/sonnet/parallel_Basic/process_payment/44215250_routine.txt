1. **Final Personalized Routine**

1. Assess Payment Urgency
   The payment urgency is high, and the balance is 30 days overdue. Inform the client: "This payment is severely overdue; you may face additional fees."

2. Suggest Late-Fee Waivers
   • Call `calculate_late_fee_waiver_eligibility_extra(44215250)`.
   • If they are eligible, ask "We can waive $1 in late fees. Shall I apply that for you?"
   • If yes, call `apply_fee_waiver(44215250, 1)`.

3. Calculate Final Amount Due
   • Call `calculate_patient_responsibility(44215250, 'Cignexa')` to get total_due after insurance and waiver deductions.
   • Say "Your total due today is $X. Would you like to proceed with payment?" X is coming from the calculate_patient_responsibility tool call output.
     – If no, say "No problem; let me know if you need anything else," and call `complete_case(44215250)`
     – If yes, continue.

4. Ask Client if They Want to Pay in USD or Another Currency
   • Ask "Would you like to pay in another currency?"
     – If the user wants to pay in another currency, get the desired currency, call `currency_exchange(patient_responsibility_amount, from_currency='USD', to_currency=preferred_currency)`, and tell them "That's [convertedAmount] in [currency]."
     – If the user doesn't want to pay in another currency, continue in USD.

5. Process the Payment
   Inform the user: "We'll process your payment via Bank Transfer."
   1. Explain "ACH transfers take 3–5 business days to clear."
   2. Call `initiate_ach_transaction(44215250, patient_responsibility_amount)`. Make sure the patient responsibility amount is in the customer's preferred currency.
      -If initiate_ach_transaction returns transient error, prompt the client to call 1-800-555-BILL to continue the request and call `complete_case(44215250)`.

6. Send receipt
   a. Call `issue_receipt(44215250, patient_responsibility_amount)` to send an email confirmation. Make sure the patient responsibility amount is in the customer's preferred currency. Inform the user that a receipt has been sent to them.

7. Offer Payment Plan
   Ask: "Would you like to set up a payment plan?"
   - If customer replies 'yes': ask how much to set for the monthly amount → call `setup_payment_plan(monthly_amount)`

8. Finalize
   a. Provide confirmation number
   b. Call `complete_case(44215250)`
