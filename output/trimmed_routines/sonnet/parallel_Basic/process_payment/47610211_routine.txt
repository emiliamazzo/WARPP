1. **Final Personalized Routine**:

1. Check Account Status
   The account is delinquent. Note it for collections and continue.

2. Look for Outstanding Balance
   Tell the client "It looks like you have a balance to pay today. Let's get that done!"

3. Assess Payment Urgency
   Warn: "This payment is severely overdue; you may face additional fees."

4. Financial Assistance & Tax Calculation
   Inform the user that they cannot wait for insurance since the days overdue are too many and move on to step 5.

5. Suggest Late-Fee Waivers
   • Call `calculate_late_fee_waiver_eligibility_extra(47610211)`.
   • If they are eligible, ask "We can waive $4 in late fees. Shall I apply that for you?"
   • If yes, call `apply_fee_waiver(47610211, 4)`.

6. Calculate Final Amount Due
   • Call `calculate_patient_responsibility(47610211, 'BluePeak')` to get total_due after insurance and waiver deductions.
   • Say "Your total due today is $X. Would you like to proceed with payment?" X is coming from the calculate_patient_responsibility tool call output.
     – If no, say "No problem; let me know if you need anything else," and call `complete_case(47610211)`
     – If yes, continue.

7. Ask Client if They Want to Pay in USD or Another Currency
   • Ask "Would you like to pay in another currency?"
     – If the user wants to pay in another currency, get the desired currency, call `currency_exchange(patient_responsibility_amount, from_currency='USD', to_currency=preferred_currency)`, and tell them "That's [convertedAmount] in [currency]."
     – If the user doesn't want to pay in another currency, continue in USD.

8. Process the Payment
   Inform the user what you are doing before calling each of the functions:
   1. Call `get_wallet_link(47610211)` and ask them to complete payment in their browser.
   2. Call `check_wallet_payment_status(payment_id)` to verify the payment went through.

9. Send receipt
   a. Call `issue_receipt(47610211, patient_responsibility_amount)` to send an email confirmation. Make sure the patient responsibility amount is in the customer's preferred currency. Inform the user that a receipt has been sent to them.

10. Offer Payment Plan
    Ask: "Would you like to set up a payment plan?"
    - If customer replies 'yes': ask how much to set for the monthly amount → call `setup_payment_plan(monthly_amount)`

11. Finalize
    a. Provide confirmation number
    b. Call `complete_case(47610211)`
