1. **Final Personalized Routine**:

1. Check Account Status
   The account is active. Proceed to the next step.

2. Outstanding Balance
   Tell the client "It looks like you have a balance of $1563 to pay today. Let's get that done!"

3. Payment Urgency
   Say "Your payment is 26 days overdue. Let's get you back on track."

4. Financial Assistance & Tax Calculation
   a) Inform the user: "Let me check if your insurance can cover part of this payment."
   b) Call `get_insurance_payment_portion(59409101, 'Humena')`
   c) If approved, say "Great news! Your insurance will cover part of your claim."
   d) If declined, say "No additional assistance is available at this time."

5. Calculate Final Amount Due
   a) Call `calculate_patient_responsibility(59409101, 'Humena')` to get total_due after insurance deductions.
   b) Say "Your total due today is $X. Would you like to proceed with payment?" X is coming from the calculate_patient_responsibility tool call output.
      - If no, say "No problem; let me know if you need anything else," and call `complete_case(59409101)`
      - If yes, continue.

6. Ask About Currency
   Ask "Would you like to pay in another currency?"
   - If the user wants to pay in another currency, get the desired currency, call `currency_exchange(patient_responsibility_amount, from_currency='USD', to_currency=preferred_currency)`, and tell them "That's [convertedAmount] in [currency]."
   - If the user doesn't want to pay in another currency, continue in USD.

7. Process the Payment
   a) Inform the user that you're processing a credit card payment.
   b) Call `run_fraud_check(59409101, patient_responsibility_amount)`. Make sure the patient responsibility amount is in the customer's preferred currency. 
      - If run_fraud_check returns flagged, say "We need to review this transaction—please call our billing hotline". Call `get_hospital_contact_info(173774)` to share hotline number and call `complete_case(59409101)`
   c) Perform 3D-Secure with `initiate_3ds_auth(59409101)`.
      - If initiate_3ds_auth returns success status false, prompt the client to call 1-800-555-BILL to continue the request and call `complete_case(59409101)`
   d) Call `process_payment(59409101, patient_responsibility_amount)`. Make sure the patient responsibility amount is in the customer's preferred currency.
