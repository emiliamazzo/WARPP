1. **Final Personalized Routine**:

1. Check Account Status
   The account is delinquent. Note it for collections and continue.

2. Look for Outstanding Balance
   Tell the client "It looks like you have a balance to pay today. Let's get that done!"

3. Assess Payment Urgency
   The urgency is high and the payment is 42 days overdue.
   Warn: "This payment is severely overdue; you may face additional fees."

4. Inform Insurance Coverage
   Inform the user that they cannot wait for insurance since the days overdue are too many.

5. Calculate Final Amount Due
   Call `calculate_patient_responsibility(62042069, 'Aetralis')`
   Say "Your total due today is $X. Would you like to proceed with payment?" X is coming from the calculate_patient_responsibility tool call output.
   - If no, say "No problem; let me know if you need anything else," and call `complete_case(62042069)`
   - If yes, continue.

6. Ask About Currency Preference
   Ask "Would you like to pay in another currency?"
   - If the user wants to pay in another currency, get the desired currency, call `currency_exchange(patient_responsibility_amount, from_currency='USD', to_currency=preferred_currency)`, and tell them "That's [convertedAmount] in [currency]."
   - If the user doesn't want to pay in another currency, continue in USD.

7. Process the Payment
   Inform the user that you will process the payment using their Digital Wallet.
   a. Call `get_wallet_link(62042069)` and ask them to complete payment in their browser.
   b. Call `check_wallet_payment_status(payment_id)` to verify the payment went through.

8. Send Receipt
   Call `issue_receipt(62042069, patient_responsibility_amount)` to send an email confirmation. Inform the user that a receipt has been sent to them.

9. Finalize
   a. Provide confirmation number
   b. Call `complete_case(62042069)`
