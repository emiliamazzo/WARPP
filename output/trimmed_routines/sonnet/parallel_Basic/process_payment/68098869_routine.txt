1. **Final Personalized Routine**:

1. Look for Outstanding Balance
   The balance is $557. Tell the client "It looks like you have a balance to pay today. Let's get that done!"

2. Assess Payment Urgency
   The urgency is high and the payment is 45 days overdue. Warn: "This payment is severely overdue; you may face additional fees."

3. Suggest Late-Fee Waivers
   • Call `calculate_late_fee_waiver_eligibility_extra(68098869)`.
   • If they are eligible, ask "We can waive $6 in late fees. Shall I apply that for you?"
   • If yes, call `apply_fee_waiver(68098869, 6)`.

4. Calculate Final Amount Due
   • Call `calculate_patient_responsibility(68098869, 'Cignexa')` to get total_due after insurance and waiver deductions.
   • Say "Your total due today is $X. Would you like to proceed with payment?" X is coming from the calculate_patient_responsibility tool call output.
     – If no, say "No problem; let me know if you need anything else," and call `complete_case(68098869)`
     – If yes, continue.

5. Ask Client if They Want to Pay in USD or Another Currency
   • Ask "Would you like to pay in another currency?"
     – If the user wants to pay in another currency, get the desired currency, call `currency_exchange(patient_responsibility_amount, from_currency='USD', to_currency=preferred_currency)`, and tell them "That's [convertedAmount] in [currency]."
     – If the user doesn't want to pay in another currency, continue in USD.

6. Process the Payment
   Inform the user that you will be processing a Credit Card payment before calling each of the functions:
   1. Call `run_fraud_check(68098869, patient_responsibility_amount)`. Make sure the patient responsibility amount is in the customer's preferred currency. If run_fraud_check returns flagged, say "We need to review this transaction—please call our billing hotline". Call `get_hospital_contact_info(665303)` to share hotline number and call `complete_case(68098869)`
   2. Otherwise, perform 3D-Secure with `initiate_3ds_auth(68098869)`.
      -If initiate_3ds_auth returns success status false, prompt the client to call 1-800-555-BILL to continue the request and call `complete_case(68098869)`.
   3. Finally, call `process_payment(68098869, patient_responsibility_amount)`. Make sure the patient responsibility amount is in the customer's preferred currency.

7. Send receipt
   a. Call `issue_receipt(68098869, patient_responsibility_amount)` to send an email confirmation. Make sure the patient responsibility amount is in the customer's preferred currency. Inform the user that a receipt has been sent to them.

8. Offer Payment Plan
   Ask: "Would you like to set up a payment plan?"
   - If customer replies 'yes': ask how much to set for the monthly amount → call `setup_payment_plan(monthly_amount)`

9. Finalize
   a. Provide confirmation number
   b. Call `complete_case(68098869)`
