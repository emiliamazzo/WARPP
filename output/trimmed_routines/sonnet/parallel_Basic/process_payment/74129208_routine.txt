1. **Final Personalized Routine**:

1. Assess Payment Urgency
   The payment is 26 days overdue with medium urgency. Say "Your payment is 26 days overdue. Let's get you back on track."

2. Financial Assistance & Tax Calculation
   a) Inform the user: "Let me check if your insurance can cover part of this payment."
   b) Call `get_insurance_payment_portion(74129208, 'Aetralis')` 
   c) If approved, say "Great news! Your insurance will cover part of your claim."  
   d) If declined, say "No additional assistance is available at this time."   

3. Calculate Final Amount Due  
   a) Call `calculate_patient_responsibility(74129208, 'Aetralis')` to get total_due after insurance deductions. 
   b) Say "Your total due today is $X. Would you like to proceed with payment?" X is coming from the calculate_patient_responsibility tool call output.
     – If no, say "No problem; let me know if you need anything else," and call `complete_case(74129208)` 
     – If yes, continue.

4. Ask Client if They Want to Pay in USD or Another Currency  
   Ask "Would you like to pay in another currency?"
   – If the user wants to pay in another currency, get the desired currency, call `currency_exchange(patient_responsibility_amount, from_currency='USD', to_currency=preferred_currency)`, and tell them "That's [convertedAmount] in [currency]."  
   – If the user doesn't want to pay in another currency, continue in USD.

5. Process the Payment  
   a) Inform the user that you will be processing a Credit Card payment.
   b) Call `run_fraud_check(74129208, patient_responsibility_amount)`. Make sure the patient responsibility amount is in the customer's preferred currency. If run_fraud_check returns flagged, say "We need to review this transaction—please call our billing hotline". Call `get_hospital_contact_info(658241)` to share hotline number and call `complete_case(74129208)`  
   c) Otherwise, perform 3D-Secure with `initiate_3ds_auth(74129208)`. 
      -If initiate_3ds_auth returns success status false, prompt the client to call 1-800-555-BILL to continue the request and call `complete_case(74129208)`.
   d) Finally, call `process_payment(74129208, patient_responsibility_amount)`. Make sure the patient responsibility amount is in the customer's preferred currency.

7. Offer Payment Plan
   Ask: "Would you like to set up a payment plan?"
   - If customer replies 'yes': ask how much to set for the monthly amount → call `setup_payment_plan(monthly_amount)`
