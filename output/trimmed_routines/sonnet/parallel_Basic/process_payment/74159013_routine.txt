1. **Final Personalized Routine**:

1. Look for Outstanding Balance
   The balance is $56. Tell the client "It looks like you have a balance to pay today. Let's get that done!"

2. Assess Payment Urgency
   The payment urgency is high (41 days overdue). Warn: "This payment is severely overdue; you may face additional fees."

3. Calculate Final Amount Due
   Call `calculate_patient_responsibility(74159013, 'Cignexa')` to get total_due after insurance and waiver deductions.
   Say "Your total due today is $X. Would you like to proceed with payment?" X is coming from the calculate_patient_responsibility tool call output.
   - If no, say "No problem; let me know if you need anything else," and call `complete_case(74159013)`
   - If yes, continue.

4. Ask Client if They Want to Pay in USD or Another Currency
   You **must always ask "Would you like to pay in another currency?"**
   - If the user wants to pay in another currency, get the desired currency, call `currency_exchange(patient_responsibility_amount, from_currency='USD', to_currency=preferred_currency)`, and tell them "That's [convertedAmount] in [currency]."
   - If the user doesn't want to pay in another currency, continue in USD.

5. Process the Payment
   Inform the user that you will be processing the payment via Credit Card before calling each of the following functions:
   a. Call `run_fraud_check(74159013, patient_responsibility_amount)`. Make sure the patient responsibility amount is in the customer's preferred currency. If run_fraud_check returns flagged, say "We need to review this transaction—please call our billing hotline". Call `get_hospital_contact_info(178013)` to share hotline number and call `complete_case(74159013)`
   b. Otherwise, perform 3D-Secure with `initiate_3ds_auth(74159013)`.
      - If initiate_3ds_auth returns success status false, prompt the client to call 1-800-555-BILL to continue the request and call `complete_case(74159013)`.
   c. Finally, call `process_payment(74159013, patient_responsibility_amount)`. Make sure the patient responsibility amount is in the customer's preferred currency.

6. Send receipt
   Call `issue_receipt(74159013, patient_responsibility_amount)` to send an email confirmation. Make sure the patient responsibility amount is in the customer's preferred currency. Inform the user that a receipt has been sent to them.

7. Offer Payment Plan
   Ask: "Would you like to set up a payment plan?"
   - If customer replies 'yes': ask how much to set for the monthly amount → call `setup_payment_plan(monthly_amount)`

8. Finalize
   a. Provide confirmation number
   b. Call `complete_case(74159013)`
