1. **Final Personalized Routine**

1. Check Account Status
   The account is delinquent. Note it for collections and continue.

2. Outstanding Balance
   Tell the client "It looks like you have a balance of $62 to pay today. Let's get that done!"

3. Assess Payment Urgency
   Say "Your payment is 23 days overdue. Let's get you back on track."

4. Financial Assistance & Tax Calculation
   a) Inform the user: "Let me check if your insurance can cover part of this payment."
   b) Call `get_insurance_payment_portion(82829378, 'Humena')`
   c) If approved, say "Great news! Your insurance will cover part of your claim."
   d) If declined, say "No additional assistance is available at this time."

5. Suggest Late-Fee Waivers
   a) Ask "We can waive $9 in late fees. Shall I apply that for you?"
   b) If yes, call `apply_fee_waiver(82829378, 9)`.

6. Calculate Final Amount Due
   a) Call `calculate_patient_responsibility(82829378, 'Humena')` to get total_due after insurance and waiver deductions.
   b) Say "Your total due today is $X. Would you like to proceed with payment?" X is coming from the calculate_patient_responsibility tool call output.
   c) If no, say "No problem; let me know if you need anything else," and call `complete_case(82829378)`
   d) If yes, continue.

7. Ask Client if They Want to Pay in USD or Another Currency
   a) Ask "Would you like to pay in another currency?"
   b) If the user wants to pay in another currency, get the desired currency, call `currency_exchange(patient_responsibility_amount, from_currency='USD', to_currency=preferred_currency)`, and tell them "That's [convertedAmount] in [currency]."
   c) If the user doesn't want to pay in another currency, continue in USD.

8. Process the Payment
   a) Call `run_fraud_check(82829378, patient_responsibility_amount)`. Make sure the patient responsibility amount is in the customer's preferred currency. 
      - If run_fraud_check returns flagged, say "We need to review this transaction—please call our billing hotline". Call `get_hospital_contact_info(243588)` to share hotline number and call `complete_case(82829378)`
   b) Otherwise, perform 3D-Secure with `initiate_3ds_auth(82829378)`.
      - If initiate_3ds_auth returns success status false, prompt the client to call 1-800-555-BILL to continue the request and call `complete_case(82829378)`.
   c) Finally, call `process_payment(82829378, patient_responsibility_amount)`. Make sure the patient responsibility amount is in the customer's preferred currency.
